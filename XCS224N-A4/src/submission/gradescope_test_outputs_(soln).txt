So part of the <unk> practice is to recognize that under stress we're not at the best time, and you have to put the systems on your site.
And there are perhaps no more stressful situation than when you face a medical decision.
And at some point, we will all be in that situation, that we have to make a very important decision about the future of our medical attention, or one of a loved one, to help them with a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And talk about a very particular medical condition.
But this is <unk> as a <unk> for all of the decision-making decisions, and in fact for the decision-making of financial decisions and social decisions, any kind of decision that we have to take from that we would benefit from the facts.
So suppose you go to the doctor and the doctor says, "I've gotten the result of the lab, and the cholesterol result is a little bit <unk>
They all know that high cholesterol is associated with a greater risk of heart disease, attack the brain cerebral <unk>
So you're thinking that having high cholesterol cholesterol is not the best, then the doctor says, "I'd like to give you a drug that will help you reduce the <unk> a <unk>
And maybe you have heard of the <unk> and you know it's one of the most <unk> drugs in the world today.
So you think, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
But there's a question that you have to do then, a statistic that you have to ask for the most people don't want to talk about, and the pharmaceutical companies even less.
It's for the <unk> the number necessary to treat.
And what is this, the <unk>
It's the number of people who have to take a drug or give a surgery in any medical procedure before it can help one person.
And you must think about what kind of <unk> <unk> is <unk>
The number must be one.
My doctor didn't tell me something if it wasn't going to help me.
But actually, medical practice doesn't work like this.
And it's not because of the doctor, and if it comes to somebody, it's from scientists like me.
We have not understood very well the mechanisms.
But the estimates of <unk> that 90 percent of drugs work only about 30 to 50 percent of people.
So the number necessary to treat the most widely <unk> what do you think it is?
How many people have to take it before you can help one person?
300.
This according to the research research research -- <unk> <unk> and Pamela <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I just explored the numbers.
300 people have to take the drug for a year before avoid a single heart attack, or another <unk> event.
Now you might think, "Well, one chance in 300 of my <unk>
Why no, <unk> <unk> the recipe for all <unk>
But then you have to ask for a more, and it is, <unk> of the <unk> effects.
For this particular medicine in particular, the side effects of the patients.
And those include <unk> and muscle pain and <unk> pain -- but now they think, "The five percent is not very likely to happen to me, still to take the <unk>
But a moment.
remember, under stress you don't think of clearly.
So think about how to do this with time, so you don't have to make the chain of reasoning in the act.
300 people take the <unk> right? A person has <unk> five percent of the 300 people have side effects, that's 15 people.
You have 15 times more likely to go out of <unk> for the drug that you can help you the drug.
I don't say that you should not take the <unk>
I just say that you must have this conversation with your doctor.
The medical ethic is part of the beginning of informed consent.
We have the right to have access to this kind of information to start the conversation about whether you want to take the risks or not.
Maybe they're thinking that I've launched this number in the air for the value of the crash, but actually this number necessary to treat is quite typical.
For the surgery that most is done in the older men of 50, <unk> of prostate cancer, the number necessary to treat is <unk>
This is 49 surgeries for a person who has <unk>
And the side effects in that case, they produce 50 percent of the patients.
Those include <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And if you are lucky, and it's one of that 50 percent effects only <unk> a year or two.
So the idea of <unk> is to think before the questions that you can argue that you can make the conversation forward.
You don't have to make all this on the act.
And they also want to think about the quality of life.
Because it has an option a lot of times, they want a more short life of pain, or a long life that could have a lot of pain to the end?
These are the things they talk about and think of now, with their family and their loved ones.
They can change in the heat of the moment, but at least you're trained in this kind of thought.
Remember, our brain releases <unk> under stress, and one of the things that happens at that moment is that a lot of systems.
There's an evolutionary reason for this.
Face in the face of a <unk> is not necessary the <unk> system or the <unk> or the immune system, because if your body is spending metabolism in those things, it doesn't react very quickly.
Unfortunately, one of the things that are going through the window during those moments of stress is really rational thought like Danny <unk> and his colleagues have been found.
So we have to be able to think about the future to these kinds of situations.
I think the important thing here is to recognize that we're all <unk>
We're all going to fail in time.
The idea is to think about the future how they could be those <unk> to put systems in the place that will help to minimize damage, or to prevent the bad things in the first place.
<unk> at night at night in <unk> when I came back from my journey, my contractor set me a combination of combination along the door, with a key to the door, with a key to the door in the same, an easy way to remember it.
And I have to admit that I still have lots of letters that I haven't ordered and lots of messages that I haven't read of.
So I am not very important, but I see the organization as a <unk> process, and I'm doing it.
Thank you very much.
Interpreter: <unk> <unk> is my favorite musical symbol here.
It means to play <unk>
If you're playing a musical instrument and you see a <unk> in the <unk> you need to play more <unk>
Two <unk> even more smooth.
Four <unk> extremely smooth.
This is my drawing of a <unk> tree there, you see that it doesn't matter how many thousands and thousands of <unk> can be a complete silence.
That's my current definition of <unk> a very dark sound.
I'd like to share a little bit about the history of the American system, the <unk> in addition to a little bit of my own story.
The language of French signs came over the 1950s and over the time of time, it mixed with local signs and developed the language that we now know as <unk>
So it has a story about about 200 years.
I was born <unk> And I was taught to believe that sound was not a part of my life.
And I thought it was true.
However, I now realize that it's not true at all.
The sounds are a very important part of my life, they're really in my mind every day.
As a <unk> person who lives in a sound world, it's like I lived in a foreign country following the rest of their rules, <unk> behaviors and norms without <unk>
So how do I understand that?
Well, I see how people behave and respond to sound.
People are like my <unk> and <unk> the sound.
<unk> and <unk> that behavior.
At the same time, I've learned that I can create sound, and I've seen how people were <unk>
So I've learned for example.
"I don't know the <unk>
Don't do a lot of noise by eating a bag of chips.
"Don't <unk> and when you're eating, make sure we were not <unk>
This is all called <unk> <unk>
Maybe I think about the sound label more than the average person does it.
I'm a <unk> of <unk>
And I'm always waiting for <unk> the sound, which is for coming next.
From there, this drawing.
<unk> <unk>
It was going to go on.
<unk> for <unk>
You can see that the <unk> has no notes on the lines.
That's because the lines already contain sounds through <unk> subtle and <unk>
In <unk> culture, the movement is equivalent of the sound.
This is the signal to <unk> in the <unk>
A typical <unk> has five lines.
However, to me, do it with my thumb that doesn't feel natural.
That's why I had four lines on the paper.
In the year 2008, I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin, Germany, for an artistic <unk> there.
Before this time, I had worked as a <unk>
During this summer, I visited museums and spaces of different <unk> and while I went from one place to another, I realized that there was no visual art there.
At that time, the sound was the trend and that called me the <unk>
There was no visual art, everything was <unk>
Now sound has entered my territory of art.
It goes to me more of the art?
I realized that it doesn't have to be like this.
In fact, I know the sound.
I know it so well that it doesn't only experience through the ears.
I can feel it <unk> or experience it or experience it or even like an idea.
So I decided to reclaim the property of sound and <unk> in my educational practice.
And everything I had taught me about how to sound, I decided to leave it and <unk>
I started to create a new body of work.
And when I presented it to the art community, I was struck by the amount of support and attention that I got.
I realized that sound is like the money, power, the <unk> the social currency.
In the bottom of my mind, I always felt that the sound was <unk> was something from a <unk> person.
And sound is so powerful that I could be able to get to me and my art work, or I could tell me.
I chose that I was <unk>
There's a massive culture around spoken language.
And just because I don't use my literal voice to communicate, the eyes of society is like I didn't have a voice at all.
So I have to work with people who can support me as well as it and become my voice.
So I am able to be relevant to the current society.
So in school, in the work and institutions, work with many different performers of <unk>
And his voice becomes my voice and identity.
They help me be <unk>
And their voices have value and weight.
Ironically, by asking for <unk> their voices, I am able to keep a temporary form of value something like taking a loan with a very high interest.
If you don't continue to keep in this practice, I feel that I could be able to be <unk> in the forget and not have any kind of social value.
So with sound like my new artistic medium -- <unk> in the world of music.
And I was surprised by looking at the similarities between music and <unk>
For example, a musical note you can't capture and express fully on the paper.
And the same thing can say from a concept in <unk>
They are both very <unk> and highly <unk> which means that subtle changes can affect all the meaning as much of the signals like the sounds.
I'd like to share with you a metaphor for the piano, so you get better to understand how the <unk> works.
So, imagine a piano.
<unk> <unk> in many different parameters are different.
If you come up with a different <unk> for each finger as you play the piano, as the facial expression -- the body movement, the speed, the shape of your hand and so while the piano, English is a linear language, as if you were <unk> just one key at the time.
However, the <unk> is more like a <unk> you need the 10 fingers in the place to express a very clear concept or an idea in <unk>
If it just would change the <unk> it would create a completely different meaning of it.
Same thing with music in terms of the tone and volume.
In <unk> when you use these different parameters -- you can actually express different ideas.
For example, the signal <unk> on that."
This is the <unk> sign on that."
I'm looking at you.
<unk> <unk>
Oh, <unk>
<unk>
What are you <unk>
Ah, <unk>
So I started thinking, and if I see the <unk> through the lenses of music?
If I had to create a sign and it would take it over and over again, it could be like a piece of visual music.
For example, this is the sign of <unk> the sun comes out and put it up.
This is all day."
If you go to it, and you get the <unk> the visually looks like a piece of music.
Every day.
I feel that the same thing can be said to <unk> <unk>
All the <unk>
This is all night, in this picture.
And this led me to think about three different types of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I feel that the third has more <unk> than the other two.
This is what time is expresses in <unk> and how the distance to the body can express changes in time.
For example, one <unk> is a hand, two <unk> it's two hands, the present is just closer and in front of the body, the future is in front of the body and the past is on the back.
So the first example is <unk> a lot of time."
Then, <unk> <unk> <unk> and the last, which is my favorite, with a very romantic and dramatic idea at the time, <unk>
<unk> <unk> is a musical term with a specific pace of four times a <unk>
However, when I see the word <unk> <unk> I think automatically in <unk> same time."
Look at <unk> right hand -- <unk> hand.
We have the <unk> through the head and the chest.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
You can do it with me?
All of my hands in high.
Now we're going to do it so much in your head like your chest, something like <unk> <unk> or <unk>
Yeah, good.
That means <unk> in the international system.
The international system, as a note, is a visual tool to help communicate in all cultures and languages of signs around the world.
The second thing I'd like to show you is this one. Please do it with me again.
And now this.
It means <unk> in the <unk>
Now, the third. Please go back again.
And over again.
It's <unk> in the <unk>
We're going to do three together.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
Good work all.
Notice how three signs are very similar. They all occur in your head and your chest. But they get very different meanings themselves.
It's amazing to see how <unk> is alive and successful as the music.
However, today, we live in a very <unk> world.
And just because the <unk> doesn't have sound, automatically has no social value.
We have to start questioning what defines social value and allow the <unk> to develop their own value, without sounds.
And this could be a step to make a more <unk> society.
And so maybe people understand that you don't have to be deaf, to learn how to learn how to learn how to learn <unk>
The <unk> is a rich trove and I'd like you to have the same experience.
I'd like to start to open up your ears, open your eyes, to participate in our culture and experience our visual language.
And you never know, you can fall in love with us.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> Hey, that's me.
And as a child, my parents would say, "Can you <unk> everything, but then you have to <unk>
liberty involves responsibility.
But my imagination led to all these wonderful places, where everything was possible.
So I grew up in a bubble of suppose, or a bubble of ignorance -- I have to say, because the adults would lie to us from the awful truth.
When I get older, I found out that the adults also <unk> and that they are not very good to clean up the others.
Time time, now I'm an adult and teach citizenship and invention at the <unk> school of Hong Kong.
You don't have to wait a lot for my students to walk on the beach with a lot of crap.
So as well as good citizens, we got the <unk> and no, it's not drinking alcohol, and if it is, I don't get it.
It's sad to say, but more than 80 percent of the oceans contain plastic.
It's something like this.
And in the last decades, we have been coming out of these large ships and networks, how to collect those pieces of plastic to study them under the microscope, and the <unk> and <unk> this information on a map.
But it lasts for an eternity and it's very expensive and it's also very expensive to use those huge boats to use it.
So along with my students, with ages of six to 15 years, we dream to invent a better way.
We've transformed our little tiny classroom in Hong Kong in a workshop.
We started building this <unk> <unk> <unk> so that the very <unk> kids can also participate.
And I'll tell you the kids who manipulate electrical tools are really cool and secure.
Not exactly.
Let's go back to plastic.
We collect plastic and we reduce it to the size we find it in the ocean, which is very small, because of its <unk>
That's what we do.
I leave it to the imagination of my students.
My job is to try to take the best ideas from every child and try to focus on something we hope to work.
We decided that instead of collecting pieces of plastic, just <unk> information.
By the use of a robot, we take a picture of this <unk> the kids will get a lot of the robots.
And then we started very quickly what we call "a <unk>
We are so fast in creating prototypes that we ended up before lunch.
And it turns out it turns out and it turns out the web and <unk> website and <unk> it in a floating robot.
We see the pieces of plastic floating slowly through the sensor while the computer on board process this image and measure the size of every single <unk> to get a kind of plastic estimate in the water.
<unk> this invention step back on a website for inventors called <unk> with the hope that somebody else would do it even more.
The cool thing about this project is that the students saw a local problem, and <unk> are trying to fix it.
I'm going to investigate my problem -- but my students in Hong Kong are a very good kids.
Do you see the news, <unk> the Internet, and you get rid of this one.
A kid, maybe less than 10 years, cleaning up a oil, just using the hands of the hands -- in <unk> the largest <unk> of the world in Bangladesh.
They were very surprised because this is the water that <unk> is the water in which the water <unk> the water where they live in.
You can see that the water is brown and the mud and the oil is also brown and when it all <unk> is very hard to see what in the water.
But there is a simple technology called <unk> which allows you to see what's in the water.
We built a very first prototype of a <unk> which can spread through all kinds of chemicals that produce different <unk> which can help to identify what in the water.
<unk> this prototype with a sensor and send it to Bangladesh.
The cool thing about this project is that beyond solving a local problem, or to analyze a local problem, my students used their empathy and their sense of creativity to help other children.
I was able to investigate a problem to <unk> I was forced to make a second experiment, and I wanted to go a little bit more away, maybe to address a more difficult problem, and also closer to me.
I'm half a Japanese and half French and perhaps remember, that in 2011, there was a devastating earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent that he began a number of giant waves called <unk> and those <unk> <unk> several cities on the east coast of Japan.
Over 14,000 people died in a moment.
It also gives you the nuclear power plant, a nuclear power plant.
And today, according to the reports of 300 tons -- you're still being aware of the nuclear plant in the Pacific Ocean.
Today, all the Pacific Ocean has traces of pollution by <unk>
If we go to the west coast, we can measure the radiation radiation everywhere.
But if you look at the map, it looks like most of the radiation disappeared from the Japanese coast, and the majority of the time, it has safe, it is blue.
Well, reality is a little bit more complicated than that.
I have gone back to <unk> every year from the accident and involved in independent ways with other scientists, the land, the river, and this time we wanted to take the kids.
Of course not the <unk> the parents don't know.
But every night we went to the center of <unk> here you see the use of <unk>
It might seem like they didn't take the serious job, but they did it because they're going to have to live with the <unk> all his life.
Together with them we discussed the data <unk> that day and talk about what we were going to do next, <unk> <unk> etc.
And to do this, we created a <unk> map of the region around the plant of nuclear power.
We created the map of <unk> <unk> to represent data in real time of <unk> and <unk> water to simulate the rain.
We were able to notice that the radioactive powder is <unk> from the top of the mountain to the <unk> system, and <unk> in the ocean.
It was a <unk>
But based on this we organize a civil expedition the closest to the nuclear power to date.
We get down to a half miles of nuclear power, and with the fishermen of the fishermen of the area we were collecting sediments from the sea floor with a sediment of sediment as we invented and built on.
Here we see a <unk> we've gone from a local problem to a remote problem with a global problem.
And it's been very exciting to work on these different scales, also with open-source technologies and very simple source technologies.
But at the same time, it has been increasingly frustrating because we've only been starting to measure the damage that we've done.
We haven't even begun to solve the problems.
I wonder if we should give the leap and try to invent better ways to do all of these things.
So the classroom became a little bit of a small way, so we found an industrial installation in Hong Kong and we turn it into the larger space dedicated to the impact and environmental impact.
It's in the middle of Hong Kong and it's a place where we can work with wood, metal metal, chemistry, a little bit of optical biology, basically you can build almost everything there.
It's also a place where adults and kids can play together.
It's a place where the dreams of children can actually become reality with adults, and where adults can be kids again.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> We asked things like, we can invent the future of mobility with energy.
For example.
Or we can help in the mobility of the age of advanced age, transforming their sexual wheels into new <unk> vehicles.
The plastic, oil and <unk> are <unk> terrible, but the worst legacy we can leave our kids are lies.
We can't afford to protect the children of the horrible truth because we need their imagination to invent the solutions.
And so, as scientists, as scientists, we have to prepare the next generation to worry about the environment and people, and so that you can actually do something about it.
Thank you.
Two <unk>
One is made from thousands of pieces of steel, the other one of the silk <unk>
One of them is synthetic -- the other organic one.
One is <unk> about the environment, the other thing we thought about it.
One is designed by nature, the other for her.
No angel said that when he looked at the guy in Brown, he saw a figure that fight for being free.
The <unk> was only a tool.
But living things are not <unk>
They grow.
And in the smallest units of life, the cells, we have all the information required by every cell to work and for <unk>
The tools also have consequences.
At least since the Industrial Revolution, the world of design has been dominated by <unk> of manufacturing and mass production.
The assembly lines have dictated a world made of the parts, <unk> the imagination of designers and architects trained to think of their objects as <unk> of <unk> parts with different functions.
But you don't find <unk> material in nature.
Think about the human skin, for example.
Our facial <unk> are thin with <unk>
<unk> on the back are more thick with little <unk>
One acts primarily like filter the other mainly as a barrier, and yet it's the same <unk> there is no <unk> no <unk>
It's a system that vary gradually its functionality through the variation of <unk>
Here's a divided screen that represents my view of the world -- the double personality of every designer and an architect in the working between the <unk> and the gene, between the machine and the organism, between Henry Ford and growth, between Henry Ford and growth, between Henry Ford and growth, between Henry Ford and growth, between Henry Ford and growth, between Henry Ford and growth, between Henry Ford and
These two visions of the world, my left hemisphere and the right hemisphere and the right, and it is happening, and it shows up the two screens after me.
My work, in its simplest level, tries to bring these two visions of the world, away from assembly and approaching growth.
You probably ask, why now?
Why wasn't it possible about 10 or even five years?
We live in a very special moment in history, a rare moment, where they have four disciplines that offer designers access to the tools that we had never had access to before.
And in the intersection of these four fields, my team and I create.
Please meet the minds and the hands of my students.
We design objects, products, and tools and tools through scales of scale, like this robotic arm with a scope of 24 with a base base that some day not very far print buildings <unk> and graphics that are genetically modified buildings that shine in the dark.
Here we have <unk> the <unk> a archetype of the ancient Arab architecture -- and has created a screen where each passage is size to shape the shape of light and heat through it.
In our next project, we explore the possibility of creating a layer and a <unk> -- this was for a <unk> fashion <unk> with <unk> they're <unk> It's like a second skin made from one single piece, <unk> in the waist.
Together with 3D printing collaborator <unk> this layer and <unk> <unk> without the cells.
This helmet combined <unk> materials and <unk> in the resolution of 20 <unk>
This is the resolution of a human hair.
It's also the resolution of a <unk> scanner.
That designers have access to this high-tech analytical analytical analytical instruments allow us to design products that are <unk> not just the shape of our bodies, but also the physiological structure of our tissues.
We've also designed a acoustic chair a chair to the <unk> comfortable and also it absorbs sound.
Professor <unk> my collaborator came back to nature to <unk> and by designing this pattern of surface <unk> it becomes <unk>
<unk> this surface of 44 different properties that vary in <unk> <unk> and color, <unk> to the pressure points in the human body.
Their surface, like in nature, vary their functionality not through the addition to another material or another <unk> but <unk> and <unk> the material.
But it's nature <unk>
There is no parts in nature?
I didn't raised in a religious Jewish house, but when I was young, my grandmother told me stories of the Bible <unk> and one of them came up and actually define a lot of what I care about.
As she said, "In the third day of <unk> God sends off the Earth to grow a <unk> tree <unk>
For that first tree <unk> there would be no difference between trunk, including leaves and <unk>
The whole tree was a flies.
Instead, the land did grow trees with branches, <unk> <unk> and flowers.
The land created a world made of parts.
I often wonder, "What would the design be if the objects got out of a single bit.
<unk> a better state of <unk>
So we looked for the material to <unk> the kind of material of the tree <unk> with fruit and we found it.
The second most abundant <unk> on the planet is called <unk> and about 100 million tons is produced by organisms like shrimp, <unk> <unk> and <unk>
We think that if we could <unk> your property, we could generate <unk> structures in one piece.
So that's what we did.
We call it <unk> <unk>  <unk> a lot of <unk> <unk> <unk> and produced <unk> <unk>
<unk> the chemical concentrations we've been able to achieve a wide range of property, from dark, hard and <unk> to the light, soft and transparent.
To print the large-scale structures that built a system with multiple <unk> of <unk> <unk>
The robot could vary the properties of the material and creating these structures that are made from a single material -- a long, 100 percent.
When the pieces are lists, it leaves them dry to find a natural way in contact with air.
So why do we continue to design with <unk>
The air bubbles that were a byproduct of the printing process were used to contain dictatorship, <unk> that first showed up on the planet three billion years ago.
Together with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT, <unk> bacteria bacteria to capture very rapidly in the atmosphere and turn it into sugar.
For the first time, we've been able to generate structures that make their transition without <unk> <unk> and if it spread even more, to windows.
A <unk> tree <unk>
Working with an old material -- one of the first forms of life on the planet, with abundant water and with a little synthetic biology -- we have transformed a structure made from shrimp <unk> in an architecture that behaves like a tree.
And here is the best <unk> for objects that are designed to <unk> jobs in the sea, <unk> life and placed on the ground, they'll help grow a tree.
<unk> for our next exploration using the same design principles was the solar system.
We are looking for the possibility of creating clothes to keep life for <unk>
To do that, we need to dominate the bacteria and control its flow.
So like the <unk> table, we did our own <unk> new forms of life created <unk> made <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
I like to think about synthetic biology as the liquid <unk> just that instead of <unk> metals -- <unk> new biological technologies in very small channels.
This field is called <unk>
<unk> our own 3D channels to control the flow of these <unk> crops <unk>
In our first piece of clothes, they were <unk> two <unk>
The first is the <unk>
It lives in our oceans and in the fresh water.
And the second, E. <unk> the bacteria that live in the human intestine in the human lab.
One makes light in sugar, the other <unk> and it produces useful biofuels for the built environment.
But these two alliance, don't interact in nature.
In fact, it never <unk>
They're here, designed for the first time, to have a relationship on a piece of clothes.
Think about it as evolution, not natural selection, but evolution for design.
In order to contain these relationships, we have created a single channel that looks like the fatal tract that will help you make these bacteria bacteria and to make it <unk> their function of path.
So we started to grow those channels in the human body, <unk> the properties of the material according to <unk>
If we wanted more <unk> you get more transparent channels in it.
This is a <unk> system, when it spread from one end to another, it's 60 meters.
This is half of the length of a soccer field, and 10 times more than our very small intestine than our <unk>
And here it is, as a <unk> at TED, our first <unk> <unk> <unk> channels in your clothes.
Thank you.
Mary <unk> said, "We are high-tech creatures -- it's only half a <unk>
What if design would make another <unk>
And if we could create structures that increase the <unk>
And if we could create personal <unk> that <unk> our skin, <unk> our skin tissue and <unk> our <unk>
Think of this as a way of editing biology.
I call this the material.
To do that, you always have to go back to nature.
So now you know that a 3D printer can sort of sort of print stuff in layers.
It also knows that nature doesn't do this.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
This cocoon of <unk> for example, creates a highly sophisticated architecture -- a home in which they <unk>
The manufacturing is not <unk> on this level of <unk>
It does it through the combination of these not two materials, but two proteins in different <unk>
One acts as structure, the other one is the glue or the matrix, by bringing those fibers to each other.
And this happens through scales.
The silk worm is in the environment, creates a tension, of tension, and then starts to <unk> a cocoon of compression.
The tension and the <unk> the two forces of life, they manifest themselves in a single material.
In order to understand better how this complex process works, we attach a small imam to the head of a silk worm to <unk>
We put it inside a box with <unk> sensors, and that allowed us to create this cloud of points in three dimensions and visualize the complex architecture of the cocoon of the silk worm of silk.
However, when you put the silk worm in a flat patch -- not within a box, we realized that they would take a single single thing, and still <unk> <unk>
So we started to design different parts -- different <unk> and we've discovered that the shape, the composition, the structure of the <unk> was transmitted directly by the environment.
It often <unk> the silk worms to death inside their <unk> its silk <unk> and it's used in the <unk> industry.
We saw that designing these <unk> we can shape raw silk without boiling one <unk>
It was <unk> <unk> and we could create these things.
So we built this process up to the architectural scale.
We had a robot <unk> making silk silk and we put place in our site.
We knew that the silk worms are going to go into the darker and more dark areas -- so we use a solar road diagram to reveal the distribution of light and heat in our structure.
So we created holes or <unk> to block the rays of light and heat, <unk> the silk worms on the structure.
We were prepared to get the <unk>
<unk> <unk> worms to a silk farm online.
And after <unk> four weeks, they were prepared to <unk> with us.
We put them carefully on the bottom of the <unk> and as they <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and life begins again, like us, but much, much more short.
<unk> Fuller said that tension is the big integrity, and he was right.
So when it comes to biological silk on the <unk> silk -- they give up all this pavilion in their own.
And in a little bit over two or three weeks, <unk> silk worms <unk> <unk> miles.
In a curious symmetry -- this is also the length of the path of silk.
<unk> after the <unk> produce 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 <unk> in the future.
So here are the two visions of the world.
A <unk> silk through a robotic arm, the other full filled with empty.
If the last frontier of design is giving life to the products and the buildings around us to form a ecology of two materials, the designers must bring these two visions of the world.
Which brings us around, of course, at the beginning.
Here's a new design era of design, a new era of creation, which takes us from a design inspired by nature inspired by the design, which requires us for the first time, for the first time, we take care of nature.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Raise your hand if you've ever wondered what you want to be <unk>
If you had to remember what age they had when they asked them for the first time for the first time.
You can stick with your fingers.
Three. Five. Three. Five.
Now, raise your hand if the question, "What do you want to be <unk>
It has caused them some kind of anxiety.
Any anxiety.
I'm somebody who could never answer the question, "What do you want to be <unk>
The problem wasn't that I had no interest, but he had <unk>
In school I liked the English and the <unk> and the art and it took websites and I was playing the guitar in a gang gang called <unk> <unk>
Maybe you've heard about us.
And usually I like to test and persist anyway, for having spent a lot of time and energy and sometimes money in this field.
But with the time this feeling of <unk> this feeling of, this is no longer a challenge.
And I have to go back.
But then I was going to tell me for another thing, something totally different, and I was going to get rid of it, and I'm going to be <unk> and I feel <unk> I've found it <unk> and then again this point where I start to <unk>
And finally, I want to go back.
But then I'd like to discover something new and different, and I'd like to go into that.
This pattern was a lot of anxiety, for two reasons.
The first was because I wasn't sure how I was going to turn all this into a career.
I thought I had to choose one thing, deny all my other passions and <unk> to <unk>
Another reason that caused me so much anxiety was a little bit more personal.
I was worried that there was something wrong with this, and something wrong with me for not <unk>
I was worried about making engagement, or to be easier or <unk> or my own success.
If you can relate to my story and these feelings, I'd like to ask you something that I'd like to have raised me then.
<unk> themselves, where they learned to allocate the meaning of bad or abnormal meaning to do things.
I'm going to tell you where they <unk> they learned about culture.
The first question is, "What do you want to be <unk>
When we have about five years.
And the truth is that no one cares about what I would do to that age.
It's considered a naive question to cause nice answers in children like, <unk> or <unk> or <unk> or "I want to be <unk>
<unk> the <unk> <unk> here.
This question is going to take us over and over again as we grow in different ways, <unk> <unk> to students of high school are asked to pick up in college.
And at some point, "What do you want to be <unk>
It's going to be the nice exercise of being the kind of exercise that takes away from the dream.
Why?
If this question inspired kids to dream with what they might be, not inspired to dream with everything that might be.
In fact, it does exactly the opposite, because when somebody asks you what you want to be, you can't respond to 20 different things, even though you're very <unk> maybe <unk> and say, "Oh, what cute, but you can't be a <unk> <unk> and <unk>
You have to <unk>
This is Dr. Bob <unk>  and he's <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And this Amy <unk> editor would turn into <unk> <unk> and a <unk> and a <unk>
But most kids don't hear about people like this.
All you hear is that they're going to have to choose.
But it's more than that.
The notion of life is very <unk> in our culture.
It's this idea of fate or the real <unk> the idea that every one of us has something that you have to do for your time on this land, and you have to figure out what that thing is, and dedicate your life to it.
But if you're somebody who is not connected to this way?
What if there are a lot of different issues that show their curiosity and lots of different things that you want to do?
There's no place for somebody in that frame.
And so you can feel alone.
You can feel that it doesn't have a goal.
And feel that there's something wrong with one.
There's nothing wrong in you.
You're a <unk>
A <unk> is somebody with a lot of interests and creative activities.
It's a <unk>
It could help if you split up in three feet, and it could be <unk> and <unk>
You can also use other terms that we have the same idea, like <unk> <unk>
During the age of the Renaissance time, the ideal was the one that was okay in multiple disciplines.
Barbara <unk> refers to us as <unk>
<unk> any term you like or <unk> your own.
It seems like a kind of adapt to a community, we can't agree with one identity.
It's easy to see the <unk> as limitation or pretend that you must win.
But what I've learned about talking to people and writing about these ideas on my website, is that there's huge strengths in this way.
Here's three superpowers <unk>
One: the synthesis of ideas.
I mean, the combination of two or more fields and the creation of something new in the <unk>
<unk> <unk> and Rachel <unk> <unk> their interests of shared interests in creating data, travel, mathematics and design, when we start <unk>
<unk> is a company that creates some <unk> <unk>
At <unk> and Rachel came up with this unique idea for his <unk> mix of skills and experiences.
Innovation is happening at intersections.
From the new ideas.
And the <unk> with all their background, you can access a lot of these points of <unk>
The second <unk> <unk> is learning quick.
When the <unk> are <unk> we are <unk>
We look at everything we can have in our hands.
We are used to be <unk> for having been a lot of times in the past, and this means that we have less fear of testing new things and go out of our comfort.
A lot of skills are <unk> to other disciplines, and we bring all of what we've learned to every new area that <unk> so we rarely start from zero.
<unk> <unk> is a full-time <unk> and a whole <unk>
As a girl pianist -- an incredible capacity to develop muscle memory.
Now, she's the fastest <unk>
Before it become a writer, <unk> was financial <unk>
He had to learn the most fine sales mechanics when they started their <unk> and this ability helps to write a compelling pilot for the editors
<unk> is a loss of time to go to what you're going to give you even if at the end of the end you get it.
It's possible to apply that knowledge in a totally different field, in a way that you could not have <unk>
The third neighborhood. <unk> is adaptability. That is, the ability to turn into anything that you need in a <unk> situation.
<unk> <unk> is sometimes director of the middle of the videos -- other news designer website, sometimes the Internet hits sometimes a Kickstarter, sometimes a teacher, and sometimes, apparently, James <unk>
It's valuable because it makes a good job.
He's even more valuable because it can take different <unk> depending on the needs of their customers.
The journal <unk> Company define adaptability as the most important ability for development, to thrive in the 21st century.
The economic world changes so quickly and <unk> that are individuals and organizations that can be <unk> to meet the needs of the market, which actually <unk>
<unk> of ideas, fast learning and <unk> three skills where the <unk> are very <unk> and three skills that could be lost if they are <unk> to reduce their goals.
As a society, we have a great interest in encouraging <unk> to be themselves.
We have complex problems, <unk> right now, and we need creative creative thinkers to address them.
Let's say they are, in your heart, <unk>
<unk> out of the belly knowing that they wanted to be <unk>
Don't worry, there's nothing wrong with you either.
In fact, some of the best teams come up from a discovery and a <unk> <unk>
The physician can dive into a depth and put ideas, and the <unk> offers a breadth of knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But we all should design lives and careers that are going to be connected.
And unfortunately, the <unk> in a large part of them are <unk> to simply be more like their fellow <unk>
So once I said this, if there is one thing you can take from this talk, I hope it is this: <unk> with the illusion -- whatever it is.
If you have a heart, then you take it through all the media.
That's where you give the best of it.
But for the <unk> in the room, including those of you who just had to realize being one of them in the last 12 minutes,   I say, <unk> with your many weeks.
Keep their curiosity for those <unk> <unk>
<unk> the intersections.
<unk> our inner illusion leads to a more authentic life and happy.
And perhaps most important, <unk> the world is <unk>
Thank you.
In the year <unk> a woman named <unk> led to a psychiatric psychiatric <unk>
<unk> <unk> and I couldn't remember the most basic details of his life.
His doctor was called <unk>
<unk> I didn't know how to help <unk> but <unk> for her until that, unfortunately, passed on <unk>
After his death, <unk> did a <unk> and they found strange <unk> and <unk> in the brain of <unk> of a guy who had never seen before.
The most amazing thing.
If you had been living today, I could not give her more help than the <unk> gave him a few years ago.
<unk> was Dr. <unk> Alzheimer's.
And <unk> <unk> the first patient in receiving a diagnosis that we now call disease.
From <unk> medicine has moved a lot.
They've discovered antibiotics and vaccines to protect us from the <unk> so many treatments for cancer, antiretroviral for HIV, <unk> for the <unk> and much more.
But it has been made up in the treatment of Alzheimer's.
I'm part of a team of scientists working to find a cure for Alzheimer's for more than a decade.
So I think about this all the time.
Alzheimer's is now affecting 40 million across the world.
But by 2050, it will affect 150 million which, by the way, to include many of you.
If you expect to live up to 85 years or more, the possibility of contract Alzheimer's will be almost one of every two.
In other words, there is the probability of spending their years with Alzheimer's Alzheimer's or helping take care of a friend or wanted Alzheimer's disease.
Just in America, the care of Alzheimer's costs costs 200 billion dollars every year.
One of five dollars of medical assistance is spent in Alzheimer's disease.
Today it is the most expensive disease and its costs to increase a rise of five times in year, by 2050, as the generation of the <unk> began.
It may surprise you, but Alzheimer's is one of the biggest and social challenges of our generation.
But it's been relatively little for <unk>
Today, one of the top 10 causes of death around the world, Alzheimer's is the only one that you can't be able to cure or even slow their development.
We understand less Alzheimer's than other diseases because we've spent less time and money in the research itself.
The U.S. government spends 10 times more every year in the cancer research that Alzheimer's disease despite the fact that it costs us more Alzheimer's and causes a similar annual number of deaths like cancer.
The lack of resources is due to a more fundamental cause of consciousness.
Because this is what time people knows, but the whole world <unk> Alzheimer's is a disease, and we can <unk>
For most of the last few years, all of the years -- all of all, the scientists, Alzheimer's with aging.
We think it will be <unk> in a normal part and inevitable of aging.
But there's only to look at a picture of a healthy brain, healthy compared to a Alzheimer's patient to see the real physical damage caused by this disease.
In addition to trigger a severe loss of memory and mental skills, the damage to the brain caused by Alzheimer's reduces life expectancy and it's always deadly.
Remember, Dr. Alzheimer's found <unk> and strangers in the brain of <unk> a century.
For almost a century, we didn't know a lot about this.
Today we know that they're made of protein molecules today.
You can think of a protein molecule as a piece of paper that folds up as a origami.
There are places on the paper that are <unk>
And when it folds all right, these points are <unk> in the inside.
But sometimes things go wrong, and some points are going on the outside.
This makes the protein molecules <unk> each other, forming groups that can form big plates and <unk>
That's what we see in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's.
We've spent the last 10 years at Cambridge University trying to understand how this <unk> works.
There are a lot of steps, and what happens to block is complex, like <unk> a bomb.
<unk> a wire could do nothing.
<unk> others can make the bomb <unk>
You have to find the right step that we would do, and then create a drug that it does.
Until recently, most of them have reduced the wires and waited for the best.
But now there is a diverse group of people, doctors, biologists <unk> physical chemicals, engineers, engineers and interesting.
And together, we've been able to identify a critical step in the process now is testing a new kind of drugs that blocked specifically this step to stop the disease.
I'll show you some of our last results.
Nobody outside our lab has seen it yet.
Let's see a few videos of what happened when these drugs in <unk>
These are the healthy worms and you can see that they move with normal.
So these worms on the other hand, have protein molecules that stick each other inside them, as in humans with Alzheimer's.
And you can see that they're clearly sick.
But by giving our new drugs to these worms at a early stage, then we see that <unk> and live a normal life.
This is just a positive result -- but research as this shows that Alzheimer's is a disease that we can understand and cure.
After <unk> years of <unk> there are real hope of what can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years.
But to grow that hope, to beat Alzheimer's disease, we need help.
It's not about scientists like me, it's about you.
We have to convince ourselves that Alzheimer's is a disease and if we can get it, we can <unk>
In the case of other diseases, patients and their families have <unk> more research and <unk> pressure industry and pharmaceutical industry, and <unk>
That was essential to move into HIV treatment in the late 1980s.
We see that same unit to beat cancer.
But Alzheimer's patients often can't talk about themselves.
And their families, the hidden victims of their loved ones day and night, are often too much <unk> to go out and advocate for change.
So it really depends on you.
Alzheimer's is not in most cases a genetic disease.
Everybody has a brain run at risk.
Today, there are 40 million patients like <unk> who can't create the change they need for themselves.
<unk> talking about them, and help demand a cure.
Thank you.
We had this article in the 18th backbone of the New York Times, in January of this year.
To fall in love with somebody, do this.
The article is about a psychological study designed to create romantic love in the lab, and from my own experience to test it itself one night last summer.
So the procedure is quite simple: Two strangers will be <unk> to get 36 questions, more and more personal questions, and then they both look at the eyes without talking for four minutes.
Here's a couple of questions.
Number <unk> If you could wake up tomorrow with an quality or ability, which would be?
Number <unk> When was the last time I had another person?
And <unk>
<unk> that are <unk> these are more and more personal.
Number <unk> <unk> really <unk> me to your partner what you like to do, and I know I know very honest this time, and I gave things that you wouldn't say somebody you've ever met.
When I stumbled across this study a few years ago, a detail really called me the attention, the thing that two of the participants had married six months later and invited all of the lab to <unk>
So it was <unk> about this process of making romantic love, but of course, I was also <unk>
And when I was able to test this study, with somebody who knew not particularly well, I didn't expect <unk>
However, we were <unk> and --  And I thought it was a good story, so I send it to the Love column that I would find a few months later.
That was published in January, and now it's already <unk> so I guess some of you probably wonder that some of you will probably be asked to stay up with them.
And the reason I think about this is because I have done this question over and over over the last seven months.
And this question is just what I want to talk about today.
But let's go back to it.
A week before he was published the paper was very nervous.
I had been working on a romantic book in the last few years, so I had been able to write about my experience in romantic love on my blog.
But a blog input can get to a few hundreds of views as a lot, and those were usually just from my Facebook friends and imagined that my article in the New York Times would be probably a few thousand dollars.
And that came up with a very good relationship to a relatively new relationship.
But as he gave it no idea.
The paper was published on a Friday night, and then the Saturday, this happened in the traffic of my blog.
And the Sunday, I had called the satellite satellite, Show and the Good <unk> <unk>
In a month, the article got over eight million people, and I was, by saying something, little prepared for this kind of attention.
One thing is to foster the confidence writing with each other, but another thing is to discover that the loving life of one has been international news -- and that people around the world are really interested in the state of your new relationship.
And when people call it or I wrote what they did every day for weeks, they were all the same question: They still follow together?
In fact, when I was preparing this talk, I did a quick search for my email with my email with the phrase, <unk> still <unk>
And several messages showed immediately.
They were from students and journalists and strangers <unk> like this.
I was interviewed on radio and <unk>
Even I gave a talk, and a woman flew to the stage, "Hey <unk> where is your <unk>
And I immediately made a red.
I understand this is part of the deal.
If you write about your relationship in a international journal, you should expect people to feel comfortable asking about it.
But I wasn't prepared for the <unk> of the answer.
The 36 questions seemed to be <unk>
In fact, the New York Times published a <unk> article for San <unk> who included the experiences of readers when I test the study in them with different degrees of success.
So my first drive to all this attention was to be very <unk> with my own relationship.
I said not to every request that we both did a public emergence together.
<unk> interviews, and <unk> the orders of photos of us two.
I think I was afraid of becoming the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> process, a range for which I didn't feel at all <unk>
And I understand that people didn't want to know if the study worked work, they wanted to know if it was really <unk> I mean, if it was able to produce love -- not just an adventure, but real love, <unk>
But this was a question I wasn't able to respond.
My relationship was just a few months, and I felt about everything, that people made the wrong question.
How do you know if we were doing it together or not, and also <unk>
If the answer was no, I would do the experience of doing these 36 questions less interesting?
Dr. Arthur <unk> wrote first about these questions in this same study in 1997. And there, the goal of researcher was not to produce romantic love.
Instead, I was looking forward to encourage us to focus <unk> between college students, using what they <unk> called <unk> personal <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Sounds romantic right?
But the study worked.
The participants felt closer after doing that. Several later studies, they also used technical protocol <unk> <unk> as a quick way of creating confidence and interaction between strangers.
They have been used by members of the police and the community. And they have been used by people in the opposite policies.
The original version of the story, which I tried last summer, which combined personal questions with four minutes of visual contact was written on this paper, but unfortunately it never happened.
A few months ago, I was giving a talk in a small liberal arts university and then a student came up to me and said to me with <unk> <unk> the study and didn't work.
He seemed <unk> for that.
And I said, "You want to tell you about the person with the person <unk>
Well he did a break.
I think she just wants to be friends.
And I said, but they became better friends?
<unk> that they were able to get better better after trying to test the <unk>
The <unk>
So, <unk> I said.
However, I don't think that was the answer that he was looking for.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that none of you are looking for when it comes to love.
I stumbled across the study for the first time when I was 29  And I was going through a really difficult separation here.
I had had that relationship since I was 20, what I was supposed to virtually all my adult life, and he was my first true love, and I had no idea how or if I could live without him.
So I went to science.
And I was able to do everything I could find about romantic love, and I expected it to be able to be able to make the heart of the heart.
I don't know if I realized this at the moment I thought I just studied for the book I wrote -- but in retrospect, it seems really <unk>
I thought that if I was talking to the knowledge of romantic love, I would never have to feel as bad and I used to feel like I sat then.
And all this knowledge has been useful in one or another way.
I'm more patient with love. I'm more <unk>
I have more trust to demand what I am.
But I can also see me more clearly, and I can realize what I'm looking for is sometimes more than reasonably they can demand me.
What I look for from love is an island not only to be <unk> today, and to be <unk> tomorrow, but to keep being <unk> by the person I love that I love.
It may be the guarantee that people were wondering when they wanted to know if they were still together.
The story that the media talked about the 36 questions is that there may be a shortcut to <unk>
There may be a way for some way to mitigate something from the risk of <unk> and this is a very controversial story, because they fall in love with us, but it's also frightening.
But I think when it comes to love, we're very willing to accept the short version of the story.
The story of the story that says, still still together?
And their content with an answer of yes or No.
So more than a question, you know, let's make questions more difficult, questions like, how do you decide who deserves your love and who doesn't it?
How do you stay in love when things are <unk> and how to know when to cut and <unk>
How do you live with the uncertainty that inevitably comes up with a relationship? Or even more, how you live with the doubt of your <unk>
I don't necessarily know the answers to these questions, but I think they're a good beginning to have a more <unk> conversation about what it means to love someone.
So if you want the short version of the story of my relationship, it's <unk> a year ago, a known one, and I applied a study designed to create romantic love, we still get together, and I'm very <unk>
But they fall in love with not the same thing to remain <unk>
<unk> is the easy part.
So at the end of my article <unk> love didn't happen.
<unk> school, because we take the choice of being.
And I hated a little bit of reading it now, not because it is not true, but because at the time, I hadn't considered everything that that choice was.
He didn't think how many times we would have to take that decision, and how much I will have to keep doing that choice without knowing before he would always take me or not.
I want it to be enough to have done and responded to say, 36 questions, have chosen to love somebody as generous, and fun and fun and have expressed that choice in the largest newspaper in the U.S.
But what I've done, instead, is to turn my relationship into the kind of myth that I don't really believe of.
And what we're going to do, and what you may spend my life looking for is that that myth is true.
I want the happy end to implicit in the title of my paper, which is, by the way, the only part of the article that I actually didn't know.
But what I have in change is the opportunity to choose somebody, and the hope that he would also love, and it's <unk> but that's the deal with love.
Thank you.
I was raised by a bunch of <unk> and in a way I got a <unk> of the forest in a way.
The city in New York does a time.  Something that really affected me but more details to go on.
I'll start with when I was eight years old.
I took a wooden box, and I <unk> a dollar bill a dollar, a pen and a fork in her somewhere in Colorado.
And I thought some of the strange <unk> or some aliens would find this box about 500 years later and <unk> how our species <unk> ideas, for example how we eat <unk>
I had no idea.
So anyway, it's got grace because here I am, 30 years later, and I'm still making boxes.
At a moment I was in <unk> <unk> like going from <unk> and make <unk> and all of those things <unk> and I was doing a shot for my mother.
And I took a dictionary and I took it all the pages and I made a kind of <unk> <unk> the style Agnes looked at the <unk> and a bee was <unk>
Well, my mother is afraid of bees and it's <unk> to them, so I added more to the canvas, and thinking he could <unk>
Instead, the opposite happened to the opposite of a way it looked like it <unk> as a size, as if it was that I had the text with a <unk>
So I did I built more boxes.
This time, I started to add electronic elements and say, strange bottles that I was finding out on the street, everything I could find, because I was looking for things all my life, trying to <unk> and tell stories about these objects.
So I started drawing around the objects, and I realized that God of mine can draw in space.
I can flow <unk> drawing the same as a <unk> on the scene of crime.
And I took the objects and created my own <unk> of specimens <unk>
First of all, <unk> that you can have an idea.
Then I did some insects and weird creatures.
It was very fun to draw on the layers of <unk>
And it was great, because I started building exhibitions and those things, and I was making some money, to bring my girlfriend to dinner, for example, go to <unk>
It was great, man.
At some point I got interested in the human form, sculptures of the natural size of human beings in the layers.
It was great, except for one thing: I was <unk>
I didn't know what to do, because the legislation was going to kill.
And I was going to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use glass.
I started drawing on the glass layers -- similar to the drawing of a window, then in another window, and another window, and he had all these windows together and then they get a three-dimensional composition together.
And this really works, and so I could stop using the <unk>
So I did this for years, and my work <unk> with something very big -- which I call <unk>
For the <unk> I was inspired by the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> which is a painting in the Museum of <unk> in Spain.
You know?
Well, it's a fantastic picture.
They say it's a little bit ahead of your time.
Well, the <unk> <unk> this piece.
It weighs 11 pounds.
<unk> meters long.
It's got twice as a face, so it's 10 feet old.
It's a little bit weird.
Well, that's the source of the blood.
On the left, it's Jesus and <unk>
There is a cave where all these creatures with the heads of animals travel between two worlds.
They go from the world of <unk> to this <unk> <unk> <unk> where they <unk>
This is where the heads of animals are headed into the <unk> lists for <unk> mass <unk> in the ocean.
The ocean is comprised of thousands of elements.
This is a bird god tied to a <unk>
Billy Graham is in the <unk> The <unk> the <unk> platform of the <unk> <unk> the shelter of Osama bin Laden, there are all kinds of weird things that you can find if you look very well in the ocean.
Anyway, also kind of a <unk>
It's coming out of the ocean, and it causes oil in a hand while the other hand comes out of the other.
Their hands are like <unk> and it looks like a <unk> that keeps the Earth and the cosmos in balance.
So it's one aspect of the <unk>
It's a bit of a story.
That's the hand in which we <unk>
And then, when you go on the other hand, it has a <unk> like a bird, and it raises the clouds of this <unk>
It also has a <unk> <unk> tail that joins the <unk>
Anyway, its tail turned into the <unk> on a <unk>
I don't know why it happened.
Things that go out you know.
His tail ends up in an eye of <unk> which was made from terrorist cards.
They have <unk>
They were made in the 1980s, as if they were baseball baseball cards.
Very <unk> at time.  This brings me to my last project.
I'm in the middle of two <unk> One is called <unk>
This is a six years ago to do 100 of these human beings.
Each one is an archive of our culture, through media and material are <unk> dictionaries or orgasm, too.
But each acts as a kind of archive in a form of human being, and they travel in 20, four or 12 or 12 at the time.
They're like cells, they come together, they are <unk>
And you can walk between them. I'm getting years old.
Each one is basically a <unk> microscope that weighs 1.3 pounds with a human caught in its inside.
This has a little cave on the chest.
That's the <unk> it's the chest, you can <unk> the <unk>
And let me go through the rest of the body -- there's a waterfall that comes out of the chest, and they cover the penis or <unk> or whatever it does, a kind of <unk>
It's a quick scanning of these works because I can't take it for a long time.
We have layers, you can see.
This is a game in half.
This has two heads, and it's communicating between the two.
There are a bunch of pills that go out and come into the head of this strange statue
There's a little forest on the <unk> <unk>
You can <unk>
Anyway, this talk is about these <unk> like the boxes that we live in.
We're in a box, the solar system is a box.
This brings me to my last box.
It's a brick box, it's called <unk> <unk>
In this box there is a physicist, a neuroscientist, a painter, a musician, a writer, an radio, an radio, a school arm, a school arm that spread all the content we do in the world and a garden.
<unk> the box and all the people inside it hits each other like particles.
And I think that's how we change the world.
When you're <unk> who is and the box that is living in.
And together we get to realize that we're all together in this, that this illusion that we are different, these concepts of the countries, from the borders, it doesn't work.
We're all very made of the same matter and in the same box.
And if we don't start to exchange those things with <unk> and <unk> we're all going to die very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do they do when your mind?
They take a <unk>
But so that this pill has to have the pain, first about the stomach, the guts and other organs.
You take a pill is the most effective and <unk> system so that any drug is <unk> in the body.
The <unk> though, is that the <unk> any drug is <unk>
And this is a big problem, especially in patients with HIV.
When you take drugs that are <unk> these are being able to decrease the amount of viruses in the blood, and will increase the rise of cells.
But they are also known by their side effects <unk> in its most negative majority -- because in the time that it takes to get to the current.
These are regions of the body as the lymph lymph system, the nervous system, the lungs, where the virus is <unk> and not light in the stream of the patients that are attached to regular therapy with antiretroviral drugs.
However, after the treatment, the virus can wake up and infect new cells <unk>
This is the great problem of HIV treatment with the current drugs that is a treatment for life run by the oral <unk>
One day, I sat down, and I thought, <unk> to get the treatment directly to the <unk> of the virus, without the risk of <unk>
As an expert scientist in <unk> the answer was in front of me, the <unk> of course.
If you use it in <unk> for <unk> and surgery of diabetes, you can use for anything <unk> including transportation transportation of drugs.
In fact, we're already using a laser pulses to open up or drill up extremely small holes -- that open and closing -- almost the cells infected with HIV to introduce drugs.
The best people are like, "How does that be <unk>
We sent a little bit of a little bit powerful and powerful beam of the cellular membrane infected with HIV while these cells are embedded in a liquid that contains the drug.
The laser goes through the cell, while the cell absorbs the drug in a matter of normal.
Before you even realize it, the hole is <unk> immediately.
We're testing this technology in vitro or <unk> <unk> but the goal is to bring this technology into the human body, apply it to the human body.
"What is that <unk> you can ask.
Well, the answer is, through a <unk> device.
With the first head, which is our laser going to do a <unk> on the site of infection.
The second head, which is a camera, is going to the site of infection.
And finally, the third head, a <unk> that puts it up, it releases it directly on the site of infection, whereas the laser is used again to keep the cells open.
Well, this doesn't seem a lot of time.
But one day, if you succeed, this technology can lead to the full eradication of HIV from the body.
Yes. A cure for HIV.
This is the dream of all researcher of the <unk> in our case, a laser treatment.
Thank you.
In the last decade, I've studied armed groups, not <unk> organizations like terrorists, insurgents or <unk>
They do what these groups do when they're not <unk>
My goal is to understand the best of these violence.
I do a field work in the world of politics and the library.
Understanding these groups is key to solving almost everything in course, because the war has changed.
It used to be a <unk> between states.
Not anymore.
Now it's a conflict between states and actors in the government.
For example, of the <unk> arrangements of peace and 2011, <unk> went between a state and an actor.
So we need to understand these <unk> we even have to <unk> or <unk> in any process of successful conflict.
But how do you do it?
We need to know what it motivates these organizations.
We know the reasons why they do it, but no one is looking at what they do when you don't know.
The armed struggle and political policies are <unk>
It's all part of the same organization.
We can't understand these groups, not much less <unk> without a global vision.
The armed groups today are complex organizations.
For example, <unk> <unk> known for his violent <unk> against Israel.
From his creation in the 1980s, <unk> has also established a political party -- a network of social services and a military device.
Similarly, the Palestinian Palestinian known by his suicide attacks, against Israel, also runs the <unk> of Gaza from 2007.
So these groups do more than just fire.
They're multitasking things.
<unk> a complex machinery of communication stations stations from radio channels and websites and websites and strategies in social networks.
And here you have the <unk> magazine in English and published to <unk>
The armed groups also invest in a complex <unk> of funding without <unk> but by using <unk> for example, business companies.
These activities are key.
They allow these groups to increase their strength, increase their <unk> to better recruit and build their brand.
The armed groups also do something else, create stronger ties with their population investing in social services.
They build schools, run hospitals, put hospitals in professional training software or <unk>
<unk> offers all these services and more.
The armed groups also try to conquer the population by offering something that the state is not <unk> and protection.
The rise of the Taliban in a Afghanistan held by the war or even the beginning of the rise of <unk> can also understand the efforts of these groups to deliver safety.
Unfortunately, in these cases, security has a price based on the population.
But in general, they will provide social services, it means to fill a <unk> a <unk> gap by government, and it allows these groups to strengthen and increase their power.
For example, the election victory of 2006 from 2006, Palestinian cannot be able to recognize the social work of the group.
It's a really complex stage -- even in the West, when we look at the <unk> groups, we only think about the violent side.
But that's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups, the strategy or long-term vision.
These groups are <unk>
<unk> because they fill <unk> gaps by government, and emerge like armed and political groups participate in the violent struggle and give the governance.
And the more complex and sophisticated are these organizations, less we can <unk> as something contrary to a state.
How do you call a group like <unk>
<unk> part of a territory, run all of their <unk> they collect the garbage -- they run the <unk> system.
It's a war -- it's a <unk> group.
Or maybe it's another thing, something new and different.
And what is it <unk>
The lines are <unk>
We live in a world of states of nations without state, and how much weak is states, as in the Middle East in the Middle East in the Middle East and fill that gap in the U.S. actors in the <unk>
This is important for governments, because to counter these groups are going to have to invest more in a single military tools.
<unk> that state of government has to be at the center of any sustainable approach.
This is very important to establish and put the peace.
If you understand the groups that are <unk> we will understand better than incentives to bring the transition from violence to not violence.
In this new <unk> between states and actors not <unk> the military power can win some strands in it, but we don't get peace and stability.
To achieve these goals that we need long-term investments to fill that <unk> <unk> to fill that vacuum void that allowed these groups to thrive in a beginning.
Thank you.
I'm a failure as a woman and a feminist guy.
My opinions about gender equality are <unk> but I'm afraid to accept openly the label of <unk> would be <unk>
I'm <unk> but pretty bad.
And so I was going to tell me as a bad feminist message.
Or at least, I wrote a paper, and a book called "The <unk> <unk> and then in interviews, people started to call me the <unk> <unk>
So what started as a personal joke meant myself and a <unk> <unk> has become a larger thing.
Let me give you a step back.
When I was a young man, especially in my youth and the 20 years, I had strange ideas about <unk> these women <unk> <unk> with the men and that <unk> sex.
Today, I see how women are treated around the world and anger, in particular, it looks like a perfectly reasonable answer.
But at the time, I was worried about the tone that I was using people in the <unk> that I could be a feminist point.
It will be labeled a feminist was a <unk> a taboo and taboo and disgusting.
I was <unk> as a woman who doesn't follow the rules, which asks too much, with high self-esteem and dare believe that it's equal or higher to a man.
Nobody wants to be that woman <unk> until it realizes that it's actually that woman and you can't imagine being another person.
And over time, as I went growing, I started to accept that I am, in fact, feminist, and also, proud of it.
For me, certain claims are <unk> women are equal to men.
It would be the same thing for the same work.
We have the right to travel around the world as the <unk> free or violence.
We have the right to use very easy and accessible to the contraceptives and services.
We have the right to decide about our bodies, without the need for <unk> or tenets of <unk>
We have the right to respect.
There's more.
When you talk about women's needs of women, you have to have our other <unk>
We're not just women.
We are people with a different body, expression of gender, religion and <unk> condition, social condition, skills and much more.
We have to look at these differences and how we get rid of the same way that matter what we have in common.
Without this kind of <unk> our feminism is nothing.
For me, these truths are <unk> but to be clear. I'm a disaster.
I'm full of hope.
There's a lot of things that make me a bad feminist point.
I have another confession.
When I go to work, I hear rap music <unk> to all volume.
Even though the letter degrades the women and it brings me into a deep way, the classic <unk> <unk> of tea.
<unk> actually with your <unk>
<unk> <unk>
Think about it.
<unk> poetry, right?
I'm completely <unk> by my musical stories.
I believe firmly in the work of man, which is all I don't want to do, <unk> --  -- all the <unk> tasks, but also killing insects, the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
The pink is my favorite color.
<unk> of fashion magazines and the nice things.
I can see "The <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and I have erotic fantasies of the stories that make it happen.
Some of my crimes are more <unk>
If a woman wants to adopt the name of his husband, it's his choice, and I'm not who for <unk>
If a woman decides to stay home to raise their children, I hate that choice, too.
The problem is not that it becomes economically vulnerable through this same choice, the problem is that our society is <unk> so that women are economically vulnerable when they <unk>
So we got this problem.
<unk> the conventional feminism that has ignored or <unk> historically the needs of color women in the color, the gay workers, gay workers and <unk> for women white <unk> <unk>
And remember, if that's good feminism feminism is a very bad feminist thing.
It also happens to be the following: As usual. I feel a lot of pressure.
We have this tendency to put <unk> <unk> in a <unk>
We hope it will be <unk>
When we get rid of the <unk> with a lot taste from the same <unk> where the <unk>
As I said, I'm a <unk> I already consider myself from that <unk> before I try to put up there.
<unk> women, particularly innovative and leaders of the sector, are afraid of being tagged as <unk>
They have a fear of standing up and say, "Yes, I'm a fear of fear of what that <unk> is afraid of fear not to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
Let's take an example to <unk> or like I call it.
In the last few years, it's a feminist <unk>
In <unk> Music <unk> in 2014, in <unk> <unk> in front of the word <unk> <unk>
It was a <unk> show to see this star <unk> <unk> openly feminism and make women know women and young men who are feminist is something to be proud of.
<unk> the time, the cultural critics were making endless arguments if we were <unk> it was or not a feminist thing.
It was going to be able to make it out of it, instead of simply believing the word of an adult woman and <unk>
<unk> perfection from the <unk> because we're still struggling for a lot, we want a lot, we need a lot of <unk>
We're going to go far beyond the literary criticism and <unk> to <unk> the feminism of any woman, <unk> until it's nothing.
We don't need to do that.
The bad question, or more well, a more inclusive feminism is the point of <unk>
But what happens next?
We moved from acknowledge our <unk> to give the action and be a little more brave.
If I hear music music, I'm creating a demand for artists that would be more happy to provide a <unk> supply.
These artists will not change their way to talk about women in their songs until they <unk> change effectively in their profits.
It's certainly hard.
Why has their music that will be so <unk>
It's hard to choose something better and so easy to justify a worst choice.
But when bad decisions they justify this makes it more difficult for women to achieve equality, equality that we all deserve and our responsibility.
I think of my <unk> three and four years.
These are two girls <unk> <unk> and <unk> and also very brave. I want you to grow in a world.
Where they were being told by the strong creatures that they are.
I think of them, all of a sudden, the best option would be <unk> as something much easier to do.
We can all make better decisions.
We can change the channel when a TV program comes to sexual violence against women as sports, <unk> the <unk>
We can change the radio <unk> when we heard songs that treat women as nothing.
We can spend our money to go to film in another part when movies are not treating women more than as <unk> objects.
We can stop supporting professional sports sports where athletes are treating their peers as <unk>
In any case, men, especially white men can say, "No, I'm not going to publish in his magazine, participate in his project, or work with you, until it doesn't include a number enough of women, so much to participate as to make decisions.
I'm not going to work with you until your <unk> or your organization is more <unk> with a broader range of people."
Those of us who are <unk> but <unk> to participate in this kind of projects, we can also be able to be including as much as we have to be <unk> to overcome the barriers to the decision jobs.
Because we're not <unk> <unk> Without these efforts, without adopt these <unk> our achievements will mean very little.
We can make these small acts of courage and expect our decisions to get to the top, to people in the power and producers and music producers and music, <unk> the <unk> the people who can make great decisions, more brave and significant change.
We can also say with courage our parents, well, bad, or any <unk>
The last line of my book <unk> <unk> says, <unk> is a bad feminist to not be in <unk>
This is true because of a lot of reasons, but I say, above all, because I <unk> my voice was <unk> and feminism helped me <unk>
There was a incident.
I call it an incident to address what happened.
A few kids were excited when I was very young, and I didn't know that kids can do this to a girl.
They were treated as if it was nothing.
I started to believe that it was nothing.
<unk> my voice, and after all of it wouldn't tell me that I could say something that might matter.
But -- I was writing.
And I went back to <unk>
I was <unk> in a stronger version of myself.
I read the words of those women who could understand a story like mine, and the women who looked like me and they understood what it meant to live in this world if you have the brown skin.
I read the words of the women who showed me that it wasn't nothing.
I learned to write like them, and then I learned to write like myself.
I found my voice again, and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what you can measure.
Through writing and through the question, I also found that if it was a bit brave -- another woman could hear and see that none of us is the nothing that the world is trying to tell us that we are.
In one hand, I have the power to achieve anything.
And on the other, I argue the fact that I'm just a woman.
I am a bad <unk> I'm a good woman, I'm trying to improve my way to think, what I say and what I do, without leaving everything that makes me human.
I hope we can all do the same thing.
I hope that we could all be a little bit courageous, when you need to be a <unk>
Right after Christmas last year, <unk> kids in California, had been <unk> by having visited <unk> or to be exposed to someone who had been there.
The virus then went through the border with Canada, <unk> over 100 children in <unk>
One of the things that are <unk> from this outbreak is that the <unk> that can be fatal for a child with an immune immune system, is one of the world's greatest diseases in the world.
There is an effective vaccine against this for more than half a century -- but many of the kids involved in the <unk> outbreak had not been gay.
But a moment, was not the article that unleashed the controversial thing about autism and vaccines that are delivered and marked by being a <unk> fraud by the British Medical Center.
It doesn't believe the majority of intelligent scientists that the vaccine is that vaccines cause autism is a <unk>
I think most of you know, but millions of parents around the world are still <unk> that vaccines put in danger to their children of having autism.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of the growth of autism in time.
For most of the 20th century, autism was considered a very strange disease.
The few psychologists and head-tail-head who had heard about she believed to develop their entire professional life without seeing one case.
For decades, the prevalence of prevalence continued to only three or four children per 10,000 <unk>
But then, in the 1990s, the numbers started to <unk>
<unk> of funds like <unk> <unk> are <unk> <unk> to autism as a epidemic as if I could be able to make another child in <unk>
What's going on?
If you're not vaccines, what is it?
If you ask people at the Center for Disease Control what is going on, they tend to be based on phrases like <unk> diagnosis and <unk> <unk> to explain these <unk> numbers.
But that kind of language doesn't <unk> a lot of the fears of a young mother looking for the face of his son of two years, the visual contact.
If the diagnosis of diagnosis had to be <unk> why were they so <unk>
Why were the autism cases of autism as hard to find before the decade of <unk>
Five years ago, I decided to discover the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened has to be less than to do with the slow progress and <unk> of the science that with the <unk> power of storytelling.
For most of the 20th century, the doctors told a story about what autism and how was discovered, but that story turned out to be fake, and the consequences of the same are having a devastating impact on global public health.
There was a second more accurate history of autism than had lost and forgotten in the dark corner of the clinical literature.
This second story tells us all about how we got here and where we have to go.
The first story starts with a child psychiatrist <unk> <unk> at Johns Hopkins <unk> in <unk> <unk> published an article that describes 11 young patients who looked like <unk> private worlds, to people around their own parents.
They could fun for hours by the hands of their faces, but they were <unk> from panic by <unk> like when they didn't put their favorite toy in their standard place without knowing them.
On the basis of the patients treated in their clinic, <unk> <unk> that autism is very rare.
For the decade of 1950, as the main authority of the world in the subject, declared that I had seen less than 150 real cases of his syndrome as it was <unk> of places that are so distant as South Africa.
This is actually not wonder, because the criteria of <unk> for autism diagnosis were very <unk>
For example, we would have to give that diagnosis to children with <unk> but now we know the epilepsy is very common in autism.
And once he <unk> that he had become nine in every 10 children sent out of other people to his doctor's office, without giving them a diagnosis of autism.
<unk> was a smart man, but part of his theories were not <unk>
<unk> autism as a form of child childhood caused by cold parents.
These kids, he said, have been very carefully kept in a refrigerator that wouldn't be <unk>
At the same time, however, I noticed that some of his young patients had special skills that they engage in certain areas like music, mathematics and memory.
One of the kids in your clinic could distinguish between 18 <unk> before I went to the age of two years.
When his mother put one of his favorite records, he correctly said, <unk>
But <unk> had a bad opinion of these skills, creating things like the kids were just <unk> what they had heard of their parents will be desperate to win their <unk>
As a result, autism became a source of embarrassment for families, and two generations of autistic children were sent to institutions for their own good, becoming invisible to the world in general.
Now, amazingly, it wasn't until the 1970s, the researchers started to test the <unk> theory that autism was weird.
<unk> <unk> a cognitive cognitive psychologist in London, I thought the theory of the <unk> mothers of <unk> was pretty stupid.
She and her husband has been warm and warm and <unk> and they had a deep autistic daughter called <unk>
<unk> and John knew how hard it was to raise a girl like hey.
To stand at the National Service Service, that they needed more resources for people who were autistic and their families <unk> and their colleague Judith Raleigh decided to do something that should have done 30 years before.
They did a prevalence of autism in the general population.
<unk> a suburb from London called <unk> to try to find people autistic in the community.
What you saw was that the <unk> model was too limited, because the reality of autism was much more <unk> and diverse in a diverse way.
Some kids could not speak at all, while others were <unk> in their fascination in the aliens in dinosaurs or in the <unk> of <unk>
In another way, these kids didn't fit in nice <unk> and <unk> as <unk> said, and they saw a lot of them, much more than the <unk> model of <unk> would have happened.
At first, they were lost to try and make sense of the data.
How did no one have been aware of these kids before?
But then <unk> I found a reference to an article published in <unk> the next year, the next year to the <unk> article and then <unk> buried under the ashes of a terrible time that nobody wanted to remember.
<unk> I knew about this article of competition, but he stopped <unk> on his own work.
There was not even a translation in the English, but luckily, the husband of <unk> talked German talked German -- and he <unk> it for her.
The document offers an alternative story of autism.
His author was a man named Hans <unk> who ran a integrated clinic with an integrated school with the 1930s.
<unk> ideas for teaching children with learning children were <unk> even for contemporary standards.
And the morning in his clinic started with exercises with music, and children still follow their games at the afternoon.
Instead of blame the parents of causing autism, having described it as a <unk> disability of life that required forms of support and <unk> spaces for the course of all life.
Instead of treating kids in their clinic as patients, <unk> he called them their little teachers, and he went to help the development of education methods that were especially right for them.
And so I got out of it, he saw autism as a diverse continuum that included an amazing variety of success and disability.
He believed that autism and autistic traits were common and they've always been, looking at aspects of this continuum in <unk> known to pop-up culture as the awkward social scientist, and Professor <unk>
He was beyond even until I say, for success in science and art, a bit of autism is essential.
<unk> and Judith discovered that <unk> was wrong in that autism was <unk> as well as the parents were <unk>
In the next few years, they worked silent with the American Association of <unk> to extend the criteria of diagnosis that reflect the diversity of what they called <unk> <unk>
By the end of the '80s and early '90s, their changes went into <unk> <unk> the limited model of <unk> by a wide <unk>
These changes didn't have a <unk>
<unk> when I <unk> and Judith worked on the back to reform these <unk> people around the world see an autistic adult for the first time.
Before I came out <unk> <unk> in 1988, just a little circle, <unk> by experts knew what autism, but after the <unk> performance of <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> and the recognition of <unk> <unk> with four awards of <unk> <unk> liberal teachers and parents from everybody knew what autism.
At the same time, the first clinical trials were introduced to use to diagnose autism.
I didn't have to have a connection with that little circle of experts to get a diagnosis for their son.
The combination of <unk> <unk> the changes in the criteria and the introduction of these trials created a network, a perfect storm of the awareness of autism.
The number of diagnostics started <unk> the same as they predicted <unk> and <unk> in fact they hoped that it were, so what the people with autism and their families finally <unk> the support and services that are <unk>
So Andrew <unk> came to blame vaccines on the <unk> and a simple powerful, and <unk> history -- so bad history like the <unk> theory that autism was <unk>
If the current estimate of the center of prevention that one of every 68 children in the United States are in the spectrum, is right, the <unk> are one of the world's largest groups in the world.
In the last few years, people have joined the Internet to reject the idea that they are the puzzles for solving the new medical advances -- <unk> the term <unk> to celebrate the varieties of human cognition, human cognition, human evolution.
A way to understand <unk> is to think of terms of human operating systems.
The fact that a PC doesn't work with Windows doesn't mean it's <unk>
According to the <unk> standards, the normal human brain is easily <unk> social <unk> and it suffers from a attention deficit to the details.
No doubt people have a difficulty to live in a world that was not built for them.
70 years later, we're still getting to <unk> which creates that the <unk> for the most <unk> aspects of autism are in the understanding of teachers, employers with ability, communities communities and parents in the potential of their children.
A autistic woman called <unk> <unk> once said, "We need all the hands on cover to <unk> the boat of <unk>
As we get to a uncertain future, we need all the forms of human intelligence on the planet to address the challenges that we face as society.
We can't allow us to raise your brain.
Thank you.
