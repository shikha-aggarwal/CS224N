So part of <unk> practice is to recognize that under stress we're not going to be at the best time, and you have to put the systems on your site.
And there is perhaps not more stressful <unk> which when you face a medical decision.
And at some point, we're all going to be in that situation, to have to make a very important decision about the future of our health care or a loved one, to help you with a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And talk about a very particular medical condition.
But this is <unk> like a <unk> for all of medical decisions and in fact for making financial decisions and social decisions, any kind of decision that you have to take from the fact that we would benefit an rational assessment of the facts.
So suppose you go to the doctor and the doctor says, "I've received the result of the lab and the cholesterol is a little bit <unk>
They all know that high cholesterol cholesterol is associated with a greater risk of heart disease, attack the heart <unk>
So you're thinking that having high cholesterol cholesterol is not the best, then the doctor says, "I'd like to <unk> a drug that will help you reduce the <unk> a <unk>
And maybe you have heard of the <unk> and you know that it's one of the most <unk> drugs in the world today.
So you think, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
But there is a question that you have to do then, a statistic that you have to ask for that most doctors don't want to talk and companies even less.
It's to <unk> the number necessary to treat.
And what is this, the <unk>
It is the number of people who have to take a drug or put a surgery into any medical procedure before you can help a person.
And because of what kind of statistical statistic is <unk>
The number must be one.
My doctor didn't tell me something if it wasn't to help me.
But actually, medical practice doesn't work like this.
And it's not the guilt of the doctor, and if it is to somebody, it's scientists like me.
We haven't understood very well <unk>
But the estimates of <unk> that 90 percent of drugs work only 30 percent of the people.
So the number you need to treat the most widely <unk> which think it is?
How many people have to take it before they can help a person?
300.
This is according to the research of the researchers at the other end of the researchers -- <unk> and Pamela <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I just explore the numbers.
300 people have to take the drug for a year before they avoid a single heart attack, stroke or a brain event.
Now maybe it's going to think, "Well, one chance in 300 of my <unk>
Why no, <unk> <unk> the recipe for all <unk>
But then you must ask for a more, and it is, <unk> of the <unk> effects.
For this particular drug, the side effects produced in five percent of the patients.
And those include things <unk> <unk> muscle pain and <unk> pain, but now they think, "The five percent is not very likely to pass me to me, still <unk>
But a moment.
remember, under stress doesn't think about clearly.
So think about how to do this with time, so they don't have to make the chain of thinking in the act.
300 people take the drug, right? A person has been <unk> five percent of the 300 have side effects, that's 15 people.
You have 15 times more likely to get out of the drug that will help you the drug.
I don't say they should not take the <unk>
I just say you must have this conversation with your doctor.
<unk> medical ethic is part of the beginning of informed consent.
We have access to this kind of information to start the conversation about if you want to take the risks or not.
You may be thinking that I've launched this number for the value of the crash, but actually this number necessary to treat is quite typical.
To the surgery that is done in the older men in 50, <unk> from prostate cancer, the number necessary to treat is <unk>
So it is, 49 surgeries for a person who has <unk>
And the side effects in that case, produce in the 50 percent of patients.
Those include <unk> or dysfunction -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And if you're lucky, and it's one of that 50 percent of the effects just <unk> a year or two.
So the idea of <unk> is to think before the questions that you can ask you to put the conversation forward.
You don't have to make all of this in the act.
And they also want to think about the quality of life.
Because you have a choice of a lot of times, you want a more short life of pain, or a longest life that could have a lot of pain to the end?
These are the things that they talk about and think about the family and their loved ones.
You can change in the heat of the moment, but at least you're trained in this kind of thought.
Remember, our brain releases <unk> under stress, and one of the things that happens at that moment is that they shut a lot of systems.
There's a evolutionary reason for this.
Face with the face of a predator with a predatory face, you don't need the <unk> system or the <unk> or the immune system, because if the body is spending metabolism in those things, not react very quickly. You could get to the lunch of the lions, so none of that matters.
Unfortunately, one of the things that goes through the window during those moments of stress is the rational thought as Danny <unk> and his colleagues have shown me.
So we have to <unk> to think about the future to this kind of situations.
I think what's important here is to recognize that we're all <unk>
We're all going to fail at a time.
The idea is to think of the future how those <unk> might be able to put systems into the place that help minimize damage, or to prevent the bad things in the first place.
<unk> at night in <unk> in <unk> when I came back from my journey, my contractor installed a combination of combination along the door, with a key door to the door door to the same way, an easy way to remember it.
And I have to admit that I still have lots of letters that I have not ordered and lots of text messages I haven't seen.
So I'm not very organized, but I see the organization as a <unk> process, and I'm doing it.
Thank you very much.
Interpreter: <unk> <unk> is my favorite music.
It means <unk> <unk>
If you're playing a musical instrument and you see a <unk> in the <unk> you need to play more <unk>
Two <unk> even more smooth.
Four <unk> extremely smooth.
This is my drawing of a tree of <unk> you see that it doesn't matter how many thousands and thousands of <unk> it can never be <unk> to a complete silence.
That's my current definition of <unk> a very dark sound.
I'd like to share a little bit about the history of the American system, the <unk> in addition to a little bit of my own story.
The language of French signs came up for the 1960s and over time, and over time, they mixed with local dimensions, and it developed the language that we know as <unk>
So it has a story about 200 years.
I was born <unk> And I was taught to believe that sound was not a part of my life.
And I thought it was true.
But now I realize that it's not true at all.
The sounds are a very important part of my life, they're really in my mind every day.
As a <unk> person who lives in a world of sound, is as if I lived in a foreign country to follow their rules, <unk> behaviors and rules without <unk>
So how do I understand sound like?
Well, I see how people behave and respond to sound.
People are like my speakers and <unk> the sound.
<unk> and <unk> that behavior.
At the same time, I've learned that I can create sound, and I've seen how people are.
So I have learned for example ...
"Not <unk> <unk>
"Don't do a lot of noise.
"Not <unk> and when you're eating, make sure we don't <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
This is what I call it <unk>
Maybe I think of the sound tag on the average person doing it.
I'm super <unk> of the sounds.
And I'm always waiting for the sound to come to next.
From there, this drawing.
<unk> by decide.
<unk> to continue.
<unk> for <unk>
You can see that <unk> has no notes on the lines.
That's because the lines already contain sounds through the subtle and subtle <unk>
In the <unk> culture, the movement is equivalent to sound.
This is the signal for <unk> in the <unk>
A typical <unk> has five lines.
However, for me, doing my thumb so it doesn't feel natural.
That's why I just have four lines in the paper.
In 2008, 2008, I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin, Germany, for an artistic house there.
Before this time, I had worked like <unk>
During this summer, I visited museums and different spaces, and while I went from one place to another, I realized that there was no visual art there.
At that time, the sound was the trend and that called me the <unk>
There was no visual art, everything was <unk>
Now the sound has come into my territory of art.
I'm going to tell you more of the art?
I realized that it doesn't have to be like this.
In fact, I know the sound.
I know it so well that it's not just experiences through the ears.
I can feel it <unk> or experience visually, or even as an idea.
So I decided to reclaim the sound of sound and <unk> in my artistic practice.
And all I had taught me in the sound -- I decided to leave it and <unk>
I started to create a new job of work.
And when I presented it to the art community, I was amazed with the amount of support and attention that I got.
I realized that sound is like money, power, the <unk>
In the bottom of my mind, I always felt that the sound was <unk> it was a <unk> person.
And the sound is so powerful that it could be <unk> to me and my artistic work, or I could get it out.
I chose to tell me.
There's a massive culture around spoken language.
And just because I don't use my literal voice to communicate, the eyes of society is as if I didn't have a voice at all.
So I have to work with people who can support the same way and become my voice.
So I am able to be relevant to the current society.
So in school, at work and institutions, I work with many different performers of <unk>
And his voice becomes my voice and identity.
They help me be <unk>
And their voices have value and weight.
Ironically, by asking your voices, I'm able to keep a temporary form of value something like taking a loan with a very high interest.
If I'm not going to continue to this practice, I feel that I could be <unk> in <unk> and not having any kind of social value.
So with sound like my new artistic medium, <unk> in the world of music.
And I was surprised to see the similarities between music and <unk>
For example, a musical note can not capture and to express fully on paper.
And the same thing can be said about a concept in <unk>
The two are very <unk> and highly <unk> which means that subtle changes can affect all the meaning so much of the signals like the sounds.
I'd like to share with you a metaphor for the piano, to understand better how the <unk> works.
So, imagine a piano.
<unk> <unk> into a lot of different <unk>
If you're <unk> a different <unk> for each finger as the facial expression, the motion of the body, the speed, the shape of the hand and the speed, the way you play the piano, the English is a linear language, as if you were <unk> just one key at the time.
However, the <unk> is more like a <unk> you need the 10 fingers in the way to express a clear concept or idea in <unk>
If only one key would change the <unk> would create a completely different means.
The same thing happens with music in the way, <unk> and volume.
In <unk> by using these different parameters -- you can express different ideas.
For example, the signal <unk> in that."
This is the <unk> signal in that."
I'm looking at you.
<unk> <unk>
Oh, <unk>
<unk>
What are you <unk>
Ah, <unk>
So I started thinking, and if I look at the <unk> through the <unk>
If I had to create a sign and you put it over and over again, it could be like a piece of visual music.
For example, this is the <unk> sign of <unk> the sun comes out and <unk>
This is all the Day."
If you put it up, and you <unk> the speed speed, it looks like a piece of music.
All day.
I feel that the same thing can be said to <unk> the <unk>
All the <unk>
This is all night.
And this led me to think about three different types of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk>
I feel that the third has more <unk> than the other two.
This represents how time they express the time in <unk> and how the body can express changes in time.
For example, one <unk> is a hand, two <unk> it's two hands, the present is a little bit closer and in front of the body, the future is in front of the body and the past is on the back.
So the first example is <unk> a lot of time."
And then <unk> <unk> <unk> and the last one, which is my favorite, with a very romantic idea and dramatic idea at the time, <unk> again."
<unk> <unk> is a musical term with a specific rate of <unk>
However, when I see the word <unk> <unk> I think automatically in <unk> same time."
Look at <unk> right hand <unk> <unk> hand.
We have the <unk> through the head and the chest.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
You can do it with me?
Everybody with high hands in high.
Now we're going to do it as much as the chest, like the chest, something like <unk> <unk> or <unk>
Yes, very well.
That means <unk> in the international system.
The international system, as a note, is a visual tool to help communicate in all cultures and language languages all over the world.
The second one that I'd like to show you is this. Please do it again.
And now this.
It means <unk> in the <unk>
Now, the third. Please go back again.
And again.
It's <unk> in the <unk>
We're going to do three together.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
Good job.
Look at how the three signs are very similar. They all happen in your head and your chest. But they transmit very different meanings very well.
It is incredible to see how the <unk> is alive and a lot like music.
However, today, we live in a very <unk> world.
And only because the <unk> doesn't have a sound automatically has a social value.
We have to start to question what defines the social value and allow the <unk> to develop their own value, without sounds.
And this might be a step to make a more <unk> society.
And maybe people understand that there are no time to be deaf to learn <unk> and don't have to hear that to learn music.
The <unk> is a wealthy trove and I'd like you to have the same experience.
I'd like to let you open your ears, open your eyes, to participate in our culture and experience our visual language.
And you never know, they can stay in love with us.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> Hey, that's me.
As a child, my parents would say, "You can take it all up, but then you have to <unk>
<unk> involves responsibility.
But my imagination led to all these wonderful places, where everything was possible.
So I grew up in a bubble of innocence or a bubble of ignorance I have to say, because adults would lie to us from the horrible truth.
When I get older, I found out that adults also <unk> and that they're not very good at cleaning each other.
The time country, now I'm an adult and teaching citizen and invention in the <unk> school of Hong Kong.
You don't have to wait for my students to walk on the beach <unk> with lots of trash.
So as good citizens, we brought the <unk> and no, it's not drinking alcohol, and if it is, I don't know it.
It's sad to say, but more than 80 percent of the oceans contain plastic.
It's a bit creepy.
And in the last few decades, we've been coming out with these big vessels and networks, to collect those pieces of plastic to study them under the microscope, and the <unk> and <unk> this information on a map.
But lasts an eternity and it's very expensive and it's also very expensive, and it's also very risky to use those huge boats to use.
So along with my students, six to 15 years, we dream to invent a better way.
We have transformed our tiny classroom in Hong Kong in a workshop.
We started building this <unk> work -- so that kids really <unk> they can be able to participate.
And I'm going to tell you the kids who are buying electrical tools feel cool and secure.
Not exactly.
Let's go back to plastic.
We collect plastic and we reduce the size that we find in the ocean, which is very small, because of its <unk>
That we do.
I leave the imagination of my students.
My job is to try to take the best ideas of every child and try to figure out what we hope to work.
We decided that instead of collecting pieces of plastic, just <unk> information.
By using a robot, we take a picture of this <unk> the children were <unk> a lot with robots.
And then we created very quickly what we call a <unk>
We are so quick in creating prototypes that we ended up before lunch.
And we transform light bulbs and camera cameras on top, and we put it into a floating robot that will move slowly through the water and the plastic that we have there, and this is the image on the robot.
We see the bits of plastic floating slowly through the sensor while the computer on board will process this image and measure the size of every <unk> to get a estimate of the amount of plastic in the water.
<unk> this invention step into a website for inventors called <unk> with the hope that someone would get it even more.
The cool thing in this project is that students saw a local problem, and <unk> are trying to solve it immediately.
I can investigate my <unk> problem, but my students in Hong Kong are very <unk>
You see the news, <unk> the Internet, and they will be <unk> with this picture.
A kid, maybe less than 10 years ago, they beat a oil spill -- just using the hands, in <unk> the largest <unk> forest in Bangladesh.
They were very surprised because this is the water that <unk> is the water in which the water is <unk> the water where they live.
You can also see that water is brown and the mud and the oil is also brown color and when everything is <unk> it's very hard to see what's in the water.
But there is a simple technology called <unk> which allows you to see what's in the water.
We built a very first prototype of a <unk> that can lead through all kinds of substances that produce different buildings, which can help identify what's in the water.
And we had this prototype with a sensor and send it to Bangladesh.
The cool thing about this project is that beyond solving a local problem, or to analyze a local problem, my students used their empathy and their sense of creativity to help in a remote way to the other children.
I can investigate a problem with <unk> I was forced to make a second experiment, and I wanted to go a little bit more far, maybe to address a harder problem, and also closest to me.
I'm half Japanese and French half a French and perhaps remember, in 2011, there was a devastating earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent that we had a lot of giant waves called <unk> and those <unk> and <unk> several cities on the coast of Japan.
Over 14,000 people died in a second.
It also gives the nuclear power plant in front of the water.
And today, according to the reports an average of 300 tons are still leaking from the nuclear plant in the Pacific Ocean.
Today, all the Pacific Ocean has traces of pollution by <unk>
If you go to the west coast, we can measure the radiation radiation everywhere.
But if you look at the map, it seems that most of the radiation disappeared from the Japanese coast, and most of the time, it has safe, it's blue.
Well, reality is a little bit more complicated than that.
I've gone back to <unk> every year from the accident and independently with other scientists, the land, and this time we wanted to lead to the kids.
Of course not <unk> the parents don't get it.
But every night you put in the center of <unk> here is the use of different masks use.
It might seem that they didn't take the seriously, but they did it because they're going to have to live with the <unk> all of his life.
Together with them we discussed the data <unk> that day, and we talked about what we were going to do next, and the <unk> and so on.
And to do this, we created a <unk> map of the region around the region of nuclear power.
We created the map of <unk> <unk> together to represent data in real time from <unk> and <unk> water to simulate the rain.
So with this we were able to notice that the polar powder is <unk> from the top of the mountain to the <unk> system and <unk> in the ocean.
It was a <unk> <unk>
But based on this -- we organized a civil expedition -- the closest close to the date.
We get down to 1.5 miles of the nuclear headquarters and with the foreign aid of the area we were collecting sediments from the bottom of the sea with a tiny <unk> as we invented and build.
Here we see a <unk> we've gone from a local problem to a remote problem to a global problem.
And it's been very exciting to work on these different scales, also with open source technologies.
But at the same time, it's been increasingly frustrating because we've only been starting to measure the damage we've done.
We haven't even begun to try to solve the problems.
I wonder if we should give the leap and try to invent better ways to do all of these things.
So the classroom became a bit of a little bit so small so we found an industrial installation in Hong Kong and we turn it into the largest space dedicated to social and environmental impact.
It's in the center of Hong Kong and it's a place where we can work with wooden metal, chemistry, a little bit of biology, and basically, you can build almost everything there.
It's also a place where adults and children can play together.
It's a place where the dreams of children can actually become the help of adults, and where adults can be children again.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> We asked things like, we can invent the future of mobility with <unk> energy.
For example.
Or we can help in the mobility of the age of advanced age transforming their chairs of standard wheels in new vehicles.
The plastic, oil and <unk> are <unk> but the worst legacy we can leave our kids are the lies.
We can't afford to protect the children of the horrible truth because we need their imagination to invent the solutions.
So citizen citizens, <unk> <unk> we have to prepare the next generation to be concerned about the environment and people, and so that I can really do something about it.
Thank you.
Two <unk> <unk> two different design cultures in a radically opposite design.
One is made out of thousands of steel pieces of steel, the other one of a silk silk.
One of them is synthetic -- the other organic one.
One is starting on the environment, and the other thing did it.
One is designed by nature, the other one for it.
Miguel angel said that when he looked at the <unk> <unk> he saw a figure that will fight for being free.
The <unk> was only a tool for Miguel learning.
But living things are not <unk>
They grow.
And in the smallest units of life, cells, cells, we took all the information that is required by every cell to work and <unk>
The tools also have consequences.
At least since the Industrial Revolution, the world of design has been dominated by <unk> of manufacturing and mass production.
The lines of <unk> have dictated a world made out of parts, <unk> the imagination of designers and trained trained to think of their objects like <unk> of different parts with different functions.
But you don't find <unk> material in nature.
Think of the human skin, for example.
Our facial <unk> are thin with <unk> <unk>
The eyes of the back are more thick with small <unk>
One acts mainly as a <unk> is mostly as a barrier, and yet it's the same <unk> there is no place, there's no <unk>
It's a system that moves its functionality through the variation of <unk>
Here's a divided screen that represents my view of the world -- the double personality of every designer and architect in the work now between the <unk> and the organism between the machine and the organism, between Henry Ford and Charles Darwin.
These two visions of the world, my left hemisphere and the right, analysis, and it's shown in the two screens after me.
My work, in their simplest level, tries to bring these two visions of the world, from coming out of the assembly and moving to growth.
You probably ask, "What now?
Why was it not possible about 10 or even five years?
We live in a very special moment in history, a rare moment where they spend four disciplines that give designers access to tools that we had never had access to before.
And at the intersection of these four fields, my team and I create.
Please know the minds and the hands of my students.
We design objects, products, structures and tools through scales, very much of scale, like this robotic arm with a level of 24 feet in diameter with a basis of the point that some day not very far to print <unk> buildings, and graphs at the nanoscale facts of genetically <unk> <unk> that they glow in the darkness.
Here we have <unk> the <unk> a archetype of the ancient Arab architecture, and has created a screen where every missionary is just size to shape the shape of light and heat through it.
In our next project, we explore the possibility of creating a layer and a <unk> This was for a <unk> fashion fashion with <unk> they go <unk> It's like a second skin made from one piece, <unk> in the <unk> in flexible <unk>
Together with a collaborator of 3D printing <unk> we print this layer and 3D skirt with the cells. I'll show you more objects like that.
This helmet combines soft materials and <unk> in the resolution of 20 <unk>
This is the resolution of a human hair.
It's also the resolution of a <unk> scanner.
So designers have access to this high resolution and the instruments of <unk> it allows design to design products that are <unk> not only the way our bodies, but also the real structure of our tissues.
We've also designed a acoustic chair a chair to the same time, comfortable and also it absorbs sound.
The professor, my collaborator went back to the nature of <unk> and to design this pattern of surface <unk> it becomes <unk>
So we had this surface of 44 different properties, which vary in <unk> <unk> and color, <unk> the pressure points in the human body.
His surface, like in nature, measuring its functionality not by addition to the addition of another material or another <unk> but <unk> continuously and <unk> the material.
But it's nature <unk>
There are no parts in nature?
I didn't grew up in a religious Jewish home but when I was young, my grandmother would tell me stories from the Bible <unk> and one of them came out and really define a lot of what I care about.
As she said, "In the third day of the <unk> God sends the Earth to grow a <unk> <unk> tree.
For that first tree -- there would be no difference between trunk, branches, leaves and <unk>
The whole tree was a <unk>
Instead, the land made trees to grow trees with branches, <unk> <unk> and flowers.
The land created a world made of parts.
I often ask myself, "What would the design look like if objects were made of one piece of evidence.
<unk> a better state of <unk>
So we were looking for the material that the material is <unk> the kind of material of the tree -- with fruit, and we found it.
The second <unk> most abundant <unk> on the planet is called <unk> and about 100 million tons they produce each year by organisms like shrimp, or <unk> or <unk>
We think that if we can tune their properties, we could generate structures in a single piece.
So that's what we did.
We call it legal <unk>  We were asking a bunch of seed seed -- the <unk> and we produced <unk>
<unk> chemical concentrations have been able to achieve a wide range of properties, from dark, hard and <unk> to light, soft and transparent.
To print the structures at a large scale, they built a system with multiple <unk> <unk> <unk>
The robot could vary the properties of the material on the march and create these structures made from a single material for a single material -- 100 percent recycled.
When the pieces are <unk> it will be dry to find a natural shape in contact with the air.
So why do we continue to design with <unk>
The air bubbles that were a byproduct of the impression was used to contain <unk> <unk> that appeared for the first time on the planet three billion years ago, like we heard yesterday.
Together with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT, <unk> bacteria genetically to capture carbon from the atmosphere and turn it into sugar.
For the first time, we have been able to generate structures that make their transition without problems of <unk> and they <unk> and even more, to windows.
A tree <unk> <unk>
Working with an ancient material, one of the first forms of life on the planet, with abundant water and with a little bit of synthetic biology, we have made a structure made of shrimp depending on an architecture that behaves like a tree.
And here is the best two: for objects designed to <unk> on the sea, <unk> life and placed on the ground, they will grow a tree.
The match for our next exploration using the same design principles was the solar system.
We're looking for the possibility of creating clothes to keep the life for <unk>
To do that, we need to master bacteria and control their flow.
So like the <unk> board, we did our own <unk> new forms of life created <unk> made <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I like to think of synthetic biology as the liquid <unk> only instead of <unk> metals would be <unk> new biological shifts inside very small channels.
This field is called <unk>
<unk> our own 3D channels to control the flow of these <unk> crops <unk>
In our first piece of clothes, you get two <unk>
The first one is <unk>
He lives in our oceans and in fresh water.
And the second, E. <unk> the bacteria that <unk> in the human brain.
One turns the light into sugar, the other uses sugar and produces useful biofuels for the built environment.
But these two reasons: They don't interact in nature.
In fact, it's never been <unk>
They're here, designed for the first time, to have a relationship in a piece of clothes.
Think about it as evolution, not natural selection, but evolution for design.
In order to contain these relationships, we have created a single channel that looks like to be able to be able to make these bacteria and to help us get these bacteria and to make their way out.
So we started to grow these channels in the human body, <unk> the properties of material according to the functionality of <unk>
If we wanted to more <unk> <unk> more transparent.
This bone system <unk> when it comes from one end to another, it's 60 meters.
This is half the length of a football field, and 10 times more than our small gut intestine is.
And here it is, as <unk> at TED, our first <unk> <unk> brilliant channels with life within their clothes.
Thank you.
Mary <unk> said, "We are Islamic creatures, only half is <unk>
What if design would provide the other <unk>
And if we could create structures that increase the <unk>
And if we could create <unk> personal <unk> our skin, <unk> the tissue apart and <unk> our <unk>
Think about this as a way of edit biology.
I call this the material.
For that, you always have to go back to nature.
For now, you know that a 3D printer does in layers.
You also know that nature doesn't do that.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
This cocoon of the <unk> for example, creates a highly sophisticated architecture within which they were <unk>
The manufacturing is not about this level of <unk>
It does it through the combination of the combination of two materials, but two proteins in different <unk>
One acts as a structure, the other one is the glue or the matrix, we put those fibers in each other.
And this happens through scales.
The silk worm first goes into the environment, creates a structure of tension, and then starts to <unk> a cocoon of compression.
The tension and the <unk> the two forces of life, they become a single material.
In order to understand better how this complex process works, <unk> a small magnet, to the head of a worm silk worm to the <unk>
We put it inside a box with infrared sensors, and that allowed us to create this cloud of points in three dimensions and visualizing the complex architecture of the cocoon of the silk.
However, when you put the silk worm in a flat <unk> not within a box, we realized that we would have a flat cocoon and still <unk> <unk>
So we started to design different parts of it, different <unk> and we've discovered that shape, the composition, the <unk> structure is transmitted directly by the environment.
And they often <unk> the silk worms to death inside their <unk> their silk <unk> and it is used in the <unk> industry.
We saw that designing these scores. We can shape the <unk> silk without boiling a single <unk>
It <unk> <unk> and we could create these things.
So we managed this process to the architectural scale.
We had a <unk> robot doing silk, and we put ourselves into our site.
We knew that <unk> silk worms are going into more dark areas and <unk> so we use a solar diagram to reveal the distribution of light and heat in our structure.
And so we created holes or <unk> to block the rays of light and heat, and they roll the silk worms on the structure.
We were prepared to get the <unk>
We wanted to ask with silk worms to a silk station.
And after <unk> four weeks, they were prepared to <unk> with us.
We put them down on the bottom edge of the <unk> and as it <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and life starts again, like us, but much, much more short.
<unk> Fuller said the tension is the great integrity, and he was right.
By <unk> biological silk on <unk> silk <unk> give all this <unk> your own <unk>
And in a little bit more than two or three weeks, <unk> worms is <unk> miles away.
In a curious symmetry, this is also the length of the silk.
The <unk> after the <unk> produce 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 extra <unk> in the future.
So here are the two visions of the world.
A <unk> silk through a robotic arm, the other full empty.
If the last frontier of design is to make the products and the buildings around us, to form a ecology of two materials, the designers must bring these two visions of the world.
It takes us back, of course, at the beginning.
Here is a new era of design, a new era of creation, which takes us from a design inspired by nature to an inspired nature of design, which requires us, for the first time, that we do in charge of nature.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Raise your hand if you've ever asked you "What do you want to be <unk>
If you had to remember what age they had when they asked them for the first time.
You can <unk> with your fingers.
Three. Five. Three. Five. Five.
Now, raise your hand if the question "What do you want to be <unk>
It has caused some kind of anxiety.
Any anxiety.
I'm somebody who could never answer the question "What do you want to be <unk>
The problem was not that I didn't have any interest, but I had <unk>
In school I liked the English English and the art and the art and he ran on the website, and he was working on a rock band called <unk> <unk>
Maybe you've heard about us.
And in general, I like to try and persist in every rate, because there was a lot of time and energy and sometimes money in this field.
But with time this feeling of <unk> this feeling of, this is no longer a challenge, it comes to <unk>
And I have to get it out.
But then I'm going to tell you about something else, something completely different, and I was going to tell myself about it, and I get <unk> I have found the <unk> and then again this point where I start <unk>
And finally, I want to let you go.
But then I'd like to discover something new and different, and I'd like to go into that.
This pattern caused me a lot of anxiety, for two reasons.
The first one was because I wasn't sure how I was going to turn this into a career.
I thought I should choose one thing, deny all my other passions, and <unk> to <unk>
Another reason that caused me so much anxiety was a little bit more personal.
I was worried that there was something wrong with this, and something wrong with me for nothing.
I was worried about being afraid of commitment, or being transmitted or <unk> or my own success.
If you can relate my story and these feelings, I would like to ask you something that I'd like to have gotten back then.
<unk> themselves, where they learned to allocate the meaning of evil or abnormal to do things.
I'm going to tell you where they <unk> it from culture.
What do you do first, "What do you want to be <unk>
When we have about five years.
And the truth is that nobody cares about what they would call that age.
It's considered a naive question to cause nice answers in kids like, <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> or "I want to be <unk>
<unk> the <unk> <unk> here.
So this question is going over and over again as we grow in various ways, <unk> <unk> to school students are asked to pick up in college.
And at some point, "What do you want to be <unk>
It happens to be the cute exercise before what you take away from the dream.
Why?
If this question is inspire kids to dream with what they might be, doesn't inspire to dream with everything that you might be.
In fact, it does exactly the opposite, because when somebody asks you what you want to be, you can't respond to 20 different things, even though a serious adults may be <unk> and say, "Oh, what cute, but you can't be <unk> and <unk>
You have to <unk>
This is Dr. Bob <unk>  and he's <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And this Amy <unk> editor in <unk> <unk> a professor and a creative.
But most kids don't hear about people like this.
All you hear is they will have to choose.
But it's more than that.
The notion of life is very <unk> in our culture.
It's this idea of the fate or the real <unk> the idea that each one of us has something to spend during your time on this land, and you have to figure out what that thing is and dedicate your life to that.
But if you're somebody who's not connected to this way?
What happens if there are many different issues that bring their curiosity and many different things that you want to do?
There's no place for somebody in that frame.
And so you can feel alone.
You can feel that it doesn't have a goal.
And feeling there is something wrong with one.
There's nothing wrong with you.
You're a <unk>
A <unk> is somebody with a lot of interests and creative activities.
It's a <unk>
Could it help if you divide it into three <unk> multiple <unk> and <unk>
You can also use other terms that we would take the same idea, like <unk> <unk>
During the age of the Renaissance, the ideal was who I was okay with multiple disciplines.
Barbara <unk> refers to us as <unk>
<unk> any term that you like or <unk> your own.
It seems like a kind of adapt to a community, we can't agree with a single identity.
It's easy to see the <unk> as limitation or say that you must win.
But what I've learned about talking with people and writing about these ideas on my website, is that there's huge strengths to be in this way.
Here's three superpowers <unk>
One: the synthesis of ideas.
I mean, the combination of two or more fields and creating something new in the <unk>
<unk> <unk> and Rachel <unk> <unk> their shared interests in developing data, and design mathematics and design, to begin <unk>
<unk> is a company that creates jewelry <unk> <unk>
A <unk> and Rachel came up with this unique idea for his <unk> mix of skills and experiences.
Innovation is happening in the intersections.
That's where new ideas.
And the <unk> with all their background, you can access a lot of these points of <unk>
The second superpower <unk> is fast.
When we <unk> it <unk> we are going to do that.
We look at everything we can have in our hands.
We're used to be <unk> for having been a lot of times in the past, and this means that we have less fear of testing new things and coming out of our comfort.
A lot of skills are attached to other disciplines, and we bring everything we've learned to every new area that we have learned so we rarely start from zero.
<unk> <unk> is a <unk> full-time writer and independent <unk>
As a young girl, I had an incredible capacity to develop memory.
Now, she's the fastest <unk>
Before it turned into a writer, he was <unk> financial <unk>
He had to learn the most fine sales mechanics when they started their <unk> and this ability to write the compelling <unk> for the editors.
It rarely is a loss of time to go to what you're going to tell you even if you end up with it.
It's possible to apply that knowledge into a completely different field in a way that you could not have <unk>
The third superpower <unk> is the adaptability. I mean, the ability to turn into anything that you need in a <unk> situation.
<unk> <unk> is sometimes director of videos, other designer designer, sometimes a website, sometimes teacher, and sometimes, James <unk>
It's valuable because a good job.
He is even more valuable because it can take different <unk> depending on your customers.
The <unk> magazine defines adaptability as the most important ability for development, to thrive in the 21st century.
The economic world changes as quickly and <unk> that are the individuals and organizations that can be able to be able to meet the market needs the market that really <unk>
<unk> of ideas, quick learning and <unk> three skills where the <unk> are very <unk> and three skills that you could lose if they're <unk> to reduce their goals.
As a society, we have a great interest in encouraging <unk> to be themselves.
We have complex problems, <unk> right now, and we need creative thinkers to deal with them.
Let's say they are, in your heart, <unk>
<unk> of the belly knowing that they wanted to be <unk> <unk>
Don't worry, there's nothing wrong with you either.
In fact, some of the best teams get up from a specialist and a <unk> <unk>
The doctor can dive in depth and put in ideas, and the <unk> offers a breadth of knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But we should all design lives and careers that are going to be connected.
And unfortunately, at the very large part of the <unk> they will be told to just be more like their fellow <unk>
I once said that, if there is one thing you can take away from this talk, I hope it's this: <unk> with your inner <unk> whatever it is.
If you are a heart attack, then <unk> all the media.
That's where you give the best yes.
But for the <unk> in the room, including those who just noticed being one of them in the last 12 minutes,   I say, <unk> with your whole lot of passions.
Keep his curiosity for those <unk> <unk>
It will take the intersections.
It takes us to a more authentic and happy life.
And perhaps most importantly, <unk> the world <unk> us.
Thank you.
In the year I had a woman named <unk> they took them to a psychiatric <unk>
<unk> <unk> and couldn't remember even the most basic details of their life.
His doctor was called <unk>
<unk> I didn't know how to help <unk> but she was going to go through it, and unfortunately, it passed away in <unk>
After his death, <unk> did a <unk> and they found strange plates and <unk> in the brain of <unk> of a guy who had never seen before.
But the most amazing thing.
If you have been living today, we wouldn't have been living today, we could not give her more help that he <unk> he gave him a <unk> years ago.
<unk> was Dr. <unk> Alzheimer's.
And <unk> <unk> the first patient to get a diagnosis that we now call the disease disease.
From <unk> medicine has advanced a lot.
They've found antibiotics and vaccines to protect us from the <unk> lots of treatments for cancer, <unk> for HIV, <unk> for <unk> and much more.
But it has been progress on treating Alzheimer's.
I'm part of a team of scientists who work to find a cure for Alzheimer's for more than a decade.
So I think about this all the time.
Alzheimer's now affects 40 million around the world.
But by 2050, it will affect 150 million that, by the way, to include many of you.
If you expect to live up to 85 years or more, the possibility for Alzheimer's to be almost one of each two.
In other words, there is the likelihood that you spend their <unk> years with Alzheimer's or helping take care of a friend or being dear Alzheimer's.
In America, only in America is 200 billion dollars every year.
One five dollars of health care is spent in Alzheimer's disease.
Today it's the most expensive disease and its costs -- a increase in five times in 2050, 2050, as the generation of the <unk> <unk>
It may surprise you, but Alzheimer's is one of the biggest medical challenges and social and social aspects of our generation.
But it has been relatively little for <unk>
Today, one of the first 10 causes of death from all over the world, Alzheimer's is the only one that can't be <unk> to cure or even slow their development.
We understand less than Alzheimer's than other diseases because we've invested less time and money in the research itself.
The U.S. government spends 10 times more every year in the cancer research that in Alzheimer's -- despite the fact that it costs us more Alzheimer's and cause a number of a population that is similar to deaths like cancer.
The lack of resources is due to a more fundamental cause of consciousness.
Because this is what time people know, but all the world <unk> Alzheimer's is a disease, and we can <unk>
For most of the last couple of years, we all know, because scientists, Alzheimer's disease with aging.
We think it's going to be <unk> in a normal part of aging.
But there's only to look at a picture of a healthy healthy brain compared to a patient patient to see real physical damage caused by this disease.
In addition to trigger a severe loss of memory and mental skills, the damage to the brain caused by Alzheimer's reduces the hope of life and it's always deadly.
Remember, Dr. Alzheimer's <unk> found <unk> and strangers in the brain of <unk> a century ago.
For almost a century, we didn't know a lot about this.
Today we know that they're made of protein molecules today.
You can think of a protein molecule like a piece of paper that will fold as a origami.
There are places in the paper that are <unk>
And when it folds up, well, these <unk> end up in the inside.
But sometimes things go wrong, and some <unk> <unk> are on the outside.
This makes the protein molecules <unk> each other, forming groups that can form large plates and <unk>
That's what we see in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's.
We've spent the last 10 years at Cambridge University trying to understand how this <unk> works.
There are a lot of steps, and the identification of what step block is complex -- like <unk> a bomb.
<unk> a wire could do nothing.
<unk> others can make the pump <unk>
So you have to find the right step that we can do, and then create a drug that does it.
Until recently, most of you have reduced the wires and waited the best.
But now there's a diverse group of people, doctors, biologists, <unk> chemicals, physical <unk> engineers and analysis.
And together, we've managed to identify a critical step in the process. Now you're testing a new kind of drugs that would block specifically this step to stop the disease.
I'll show you some of our last results.
Nobody outside our lab has seen it yet.
Let's look at a few videos of what happened when these drugs in <unk>
These are the healthy worms and you can see that they move with normal.
These worms on the other hand, have molecules of protein that stick in each other inside them, like humans with Alzheimer's.
And you can see that they're clearly sick.
But when we give our new drugs to these worms at a early stage, then we see that <unk> and live a normal life.
This is just a positive outcome. But research like this shows that Alzheimer's is a disease that we can understand and cure.
After <unk> years of <unk> there are real hope of what can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years.
But to grow that hope, from beat Alzheimer's disease, we need help.
It's not scientists like me, it's about you.
We have to argue that Alzheimer's is a disease and that if we <unk> we can <unk>
In the case of other diseases, patients and their families have <unk> more research and <unk> pressure on governments, drug industry and <unk>
That was essential to move forward to HIV treatment in the late 1980s.
Today we see that same unit to overcome cancer.
But patients often can't talk about themselves.
And their families, the hidden victims of their loved ones and night, are often too <unk> to go out and advocate for change.
So it really depends on you.
Alzheimer's is not in most cases a genetic disease.
Everybody with a brain is running at risk.
Today, there are 40 million patients like <unk> who can't create the change that they need for themselves.
<unk> talking for them, and help demand a cure.
Thank you.
This article in the New York Times, <unk> from the New York Times, in January of this year.
To fall in love with somebody, do this.
The article is about a graphic study designed to create romantic love in the lab, and in my own experience when we test it back a night last summer.
So the procedure is pretty simple: two strangers <unk> to get 36 more and more personal questions, and then you both look at your eyes without talking for four minutes.
Here's a couple of questions.
Number <unk> If you could wake up tomorrow with a quality or ability, what would that be?
Number <unk> When was the last time you would go to another person?
And <unk>
And <unk> <unk> these are increasingly personal.
Number <unk> <unk> really <unk> me to your partner what like him or him, I know very honest this time, and I gave things that you wouldn't say to someone you've ever met.
When I first stumbled on this study a few years ago, a detail really called the attention, the same thing that two of the participants had married six months later and invited all over the lab to <unk>
So it was <unk> about this process of making romantic love, but of course, it was also <unk>
And when I was able to test this study, with someone who knew not particularly good, I didn't expect to <unk>
However, we would be <unk> and   And I thought it was a good story, so I send it to the 19th century, a few months later.
That was published in January, and now it's already <unk> so I guess some of you probably wonder, they will go together with them.
And the reason I think this is because I think this is because they've done this question over and over over the last seven months.
And this question is just what I want to talk about today.
But let's go back to that.
A week before the paper was published was very nervous.
I had been working on a romantic book in the last few years, so I had asked myself to write about my experience in romantic love on my blog.
But a blog blog can come to a few hundred views of views like a lot, and those were usually just my Facebook friends and imagined that my article in the New York Times would probably have a few thousands of view.
And that has a good attention charge in a relatively new relationship.
But as I gave it a whole idea.
The article was published on a Friday at night, and already the Saturday, this happened in the traffic of my blog.
And Sunday, I had been called the thing: Show and Good <unk> <unk>
In a month, the paper got over eight million people, and I was, by saying something, <unk> for this kind of attention.
One thing is to foster trust writing in terms of personal experiences -- but another thing is to discover that the loving life of one has been international news --  and that people around the world are really interested in the state of your new relationship.
And when people call it or <unk> what they did every day for weeks, always, they were doing the same question: still follow together?
In fact, when I was preparing this talk, I made a quick search for the <unk> of my email with the phrase, <unk> <unk>
And several messages came out immediately.
They were from students and journalists and strangers and strangers like this.
I was interviewed on radio and <unk>
Even I gave a talk, and a woman professor at the stage, "Hey <unk> where is your <unk>
And I immediately set up red.
I understand this is part of the deal.
If you write about your relationship in an international budget, you should expect people to feel comfortable asking about it.
But I wasn't prepared for the wingspan of the answer.
The 36 questions seemed to be <unk>
In fact, the New York Times published a <unk> article for San <unk> who included the readers of readers when I test the study in them with different degrees of success.
So, my first urge to all this attention was to be very <unk> with my own relationship.
I said not to every petition that we both did a public emergence together.
And I had a television interviews and <unk> the orders of photos of us two.
I think it was a fear of becoming the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> and a range of which I didn't feel at all <unk>
And I understand that people didn't want to know if the study worked worked, they wanted to know if it was really <unk> I mean, if it was able to produce love <unk> not just a adventure, but real love, love <unk>
But this was a question that I didn't feel able to respond.
My relationship was just a few months, and I felt, especially the wrong question.
How do you know if you put together or not, and they also <unk>
If the answer was not, I would make the experience of doing these 36 questions.
Dr. Arthur <unk> wrote first about these questions in this same study in 1997. And there, the goal of the researcher was not making romantic love.
Instead, I was looking for <unk> to foster <unk> between university students, using what he <unk> called <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
It sounds romantic, right?
But the study worked.
The participants were felt closer after doing it, several <unk> studies, they also used international protocol, <unk> <unk> as a quick way to create trust and interaction between strangers.
They have used it between police members and community. And they've used it between people of <unk> political policy.
The original version of history, which I tried last summer, which combines personal questions with four minutes of visual contact -- it was cited in this paper, but unfortunately, he never got published.
A few months ago, I was giving a talk in a little <unk> arts university and then a student came up to me and told me with <unk> <unk> the study and didn't work.
He seemed <unk> for it.
And I said, "Do you want to say that you would get rid of the person with anyone who was <unk>
Well he did a pause here.
I think she wants to be friends.
And I said, but they became better friends?
<unk> I know they were able to get better after testing the <unk>
The <unk>
So, <unk> I said.
However, I don't think that was the answer that he was looking for.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that none of you are looking for when it comes to love.
I found myself with the study for the first time when I was 29 and I was going through a really difficult separation of it.
I had that relationship since I had 20, what was not all my adult life, and he was my first real love, and I had no idea how or if I could live without it.
So I moved into science.
And I did everything I could find about the science of romantic love, and I expected that that could be a certain way to <unk> the heart.
I don't know if I realized this at the time I thought I just lived for the book I was writing about, but in hindsight, it seems really <unk>
I thought that if I was <unk> with the knowledge of romantic love, I would never have to feel as bad and used as I sat then.
And all this knowledge has been useful from one or another way.
I'm more patient with love, I'm more <unk>
I have more confidence to demand what I'm after.
But I can also see me more clearly, and I can realize that what I'm looking for is sometimes more than reasonably you can demand to me.
What I'm looking for of love is a <unk> not only to be <unk> today and being <unk> morning, but that I'm going to remain <unk> on the person I love.
It may be that this is the guarantee that people asked when they wanted to know if we were still together.
The story that media told you about 36 questions is that there may be a short short shot.
There may be a way in order for some way to mitigate some of the risk of <unk> and this is a very <unk> story, because they love us to feel beautifully, but it's also frightening.
But I think when it comes to love, we're very willing to accept the short version of the story.
The story of the story is still together?
And its content with an answer of Yes or No.
So more than a question, <unk> that we do more difficult questions, questions like, how do you decide who you deserve your love and who not?
How are you going to stay in love when things are <unk> and how to know when to cut and <unk>
How do you live with uncertainty that is inevitably coming up with a relationship?
I don't necessarily know the answers to these questions, but I think they're a good beginning to have a more <unk> conversation about what to love someone.
So if you want the short version of the history of my relationship, it's <unk> a year ago, a known time ago, and I put a study designed to create romantic love, we are <unk> we still continue together, and I'm very <unk>
But in love with not the same thing to remain <unk>
<unk> is the easy part.
So at the end of my <unk> <unk> love didn't happen.
<unk> fell in love because we take the choice to be.
And I feel a little bit at reading it now, not because it's not true, but because at the time, there was not considered everything that was supposed to be.
It was not a few times we would have both of them to take that decision, and how much it will have to keep doing that choice without knowing before he was always going to pick me up or not.
I want it to be enough to have done and responded 36 questions, I would have chosen to love somebody so beautiful, and he would have expressed that choice in the largest United States.
But what I've done, instead is to turn my relationship into the kind of myth that I don't really understand.
And what we're going to do, and what you might spend my life looking for is that that myth is true.
I want the happy happy implicit in the title of my paper, which is, by the way, the only part of the article I didn't really know.
But what I have in change is the opportunity to love somebody, and the hope that he also love, and it's <unk> but that's the deal with love.
Thank you.
I was raised by <unk> in full mountain, and in a way, I got a <unk> of the forest.
A time of New York City makes a while.  One thing that really hit me, but more details later.
I will start with when I was eight years old.
I took a wooden box and <unk> a dollar, of a dollar, a dollar, and a fork in it somewhere in Colorado.
And I thought some strange <unk> or some aliens would find this box about 500 years later and <unk> how our species <unk> ideas, for example, how we eat <unk>
I had no idea.
Anyway, it has grace because here I am, 30 years later, and I'm still doing boxes.
At a moment I was in <unk> <unk> like to go to ride and make <unk> and all those things <unk> and I was making a laugh for my mother.
And I took a dictionary and I took all the pages and I took all the pages and I took a kind of <unk> <unk> to the style Agnes Martin, the covered in Exxon and a bee <unk>
Well, my mother has a fear of bees and it is <unk> to them, so I added a lot more in the canvas, thinking I could <unk>
Instead, the opposite thing happened, somehow it looked like it grew out of size, as if you were to put the text with a <unk>
So I did that, I built more boxes.
This time, I started adding some electronic elements, frogs, strange bottles that I was finding on the street, everything I could find, because I was looking for things all my life, trying to <unk> and tell stories about these objects.
So I started drawing around the objects, and I realized that God can draw in space.
I can flow <unk> drawing just like a <unk> <unk>
And I took the objects and created my own <unk> of specimens <unk>
First, <unk> that you can get an idea.
Then I made some insects and weird creatures.
It was very fun to draw on the layers of <unk>
And it was great, because I started building exhibitions and those things, and I was making some money, to take my girlfriend to dinner, for example, going to <unk>
It was great man.
At some point I became interested in the human shape sculptures of natural size of human beings inside the layers.
It was great, except for one thing: I was <unk>
I didn't know what to do, because the resin was going to kill me.
And I was going to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use glass.
I started drawing on the glass layers -- similar to drawing on a window, and then another window, and another window, and I had all these windows together and it was a three-dimensional composition of it.
And this really worked, and so I could stop using the <unk>
So I did this for years, and my work <unk> with something very big, I call <unk>
For the <unk> I was inspired by a big measure in "The garden of <unk> <unk> <unk> which is a painting at the Museum of <unk> in Spain.
You know?
Well, it's a fantastic picture.
They say it's a little ahead of your time.
Well, the <unk> <unk> this piece.
It weighs 11 pounds.
Five feet long.
It has double face, so it's 10 feet of composition.
It's a little bit weird.
Well, that's the source of blood.
On the left, it's Jesus and <unk>
There's a cave where all these creatures with animals with animals travel between two worlds.
They are coming from the world of treating this <unk> <unk> where they were <unk>
Here's where creatures with animals are run by <unk> lists for suicide <unk> in the ocean.
The ocean is comprised of thousands of elements.
This is a bird tied to a <unk>
Billy Graham is in the <unk> The <unk> the <unk> platform of the <unk> <unk> the shelter of Osama bin Laden, there are all kinds of weird things that you can find if you look very well in the ocean.
In all ways, also sort of a <unk>
It's coming out of the ocean, and it brings oil in a hand while the other hand is coming out of clouds.
Their hands are like <unk> and it looks like a <unk> that keeps the Earth and the cosmos in balance.
So it's one of the <unk>
It's a bit of a story.
That is the hand that I <unk>
And then, when you go on the other hand, you have a <unk> like a bird <unk> and it brings clouds from this <unk>
It also has a <unk> <unk> tail that unites the <unk>
Anyway, his tail is fire by <unk> on a <unk>
I don't know why it happened.
Things that go through you know.
Your tail ends up in a <unk> <unk> <unk> made of terrorist cards.
They've <unk>
They did in the 1980s, as if they were baseball cards of terrorists.
It's very <unk> to your time.  This brings me to my last project.
I'm in the middle of two <unk> One is called <unk>
This is a six-year-old project to make 100 of these human beings.
Each one is a archive of our culture, through media and material to be <unk> in dictionaries or magazines.
But each acts as a kind of file in a way of human being, and they travel in groups.
They're like cells, they come together, they <unk>
And you can walk in between them. It's taking me years.
Each is basically a microscope of microscope that weighs 1,300 pounds with a human being in their inside.
This is a little cave in the chest.
That is the <unk> it's the chest, you can get the <unk>
I'm going to meet you for the rest of the body, there's a waterfall that comes out of the chest, and that you cover the penis or <unk> or whatever it is, it has a kind of <unk> thing.
It's a quick shot of these works because I can't afford it for a long time.
We have layers, you can see.
This is a body in half.
This has two heads, and it's communicating between the two.
There are some pills that come out and come into the head of this strange statue coming in.
There's a little scene inside the <unk> <unk>
You can <unk>
Anyway, this talk is about these <unk> just like the boxes that we live.
We're in a box, the solar system is a box.
This brings me to my last box.
It's a brick box, it's called <unk> <unk>
Within this box there is a physicist, a neuroscientist, a neuroscientist, a musician -- a musician -- a musician -- a school, a school, an editorial arm that spreads all the content we do in the world and a garden.
And they would take the box and all of the people inside each other like particles.
And I think that's how we change the world.
When you <unk> who is and the box that it's living in.
And together we came to realize that we're all together in this, that this illusion that we are different, these concepts of countries, from the borders, it doesn't work.
We're all very facts from the same stuff and the same box.
And if we did not start to exchange those things with you, and <unk> we're all going to die very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do you do when you hurt your head?
They take a <unk>
But so this pill has ever been against pain, first goes through the stomach, the <unk> and other organs.
I'll take a pill is the most effective and <unk> system for any drug medicine in the body.
<unk> though, is that the <unk> any drug <unk>
And this is a big problem, especially in patients with HIV.
When you take drugs that are being able to decrease the amount of viruses in the blood, and to increase the immune cells.
But they are also known by their side effects on their own side effects in their negative people, because in the time they take to get to the blood current. It will be <unk> and worse for the time they take in your destination, which is where it's more important, in the HIV reform.
These are regions of the body like the <unk> the nervous system, the nervous system, the nervous system, the nervous system, the nervous system, the nervous system, the nervous system, the nervous system, the nervous system, the nervous system.
However, after the treatment of treatment, the virus can wake up and infect new cells.
This is the big problem of HIV treatment with the current drugs that is a treatment of life in the way that is <unk>
One day, I sat down, and I thought, <unk> to get the treatment directly to the virus, without the risk of <unk> of <unk>
As a scientific expert in <unk> the answer was in front of me, the <unk> of course.
If you use <unk> for wounds and breast surgery, you can be used for anything else -- including shipping percent of drugs.
In fact, we're using pulses of laser to open up or drill holes in extremely small black, that open and closed -- almost immediately the cells infected with HIV to introduce drugs.
The best people ask, "How is that <unk>
We sent a little powerful beam of laser beam on the cell membrane with HIV while these cells are embedded in a liquid that contains the drug.
The laser through the cell, while the cell absorbs the drug in a matter of violinist.
Before you even realize it, the hole is <unk> immediately.
We are testing this technology in vitro or <unk> <unk> but the goal is to take this technology into the human body, applying it to the human body.
"How is that <unk> you can ask.
Well, the answer is, through a <unk> device.
With the first head, which is our laser -- we're going to do a <unk> on the site of the infection.
The second head is a camera, it's going to go to the site of the infection.
And finally, the third head -- a <unk> that adds up, it releases it directly on the site of infection, while the laser uses again to keep the cells open.
Well, this doesn't seem a long time.
But one day, if you successful, this technology can lead to the total eradication of HIV of the body.
Yeah. A cure for HIV.
This is the dream of every researcher in the <unk> in our case, a laser treatment.
Thank you.
In the last decade, I have studied armed groups, armed groups, armed groups, as terrorists, or <unk>
They are going to get what these groups do when they're not shooting at it.
My goal is to understand better to these domestic agents of violence and study ways to encouraging the transition from violent participation to violent confrontation to confrontation not violent.
I do business work, in the world of politics and the library.
Understanding these groups is key to solving almost everything in course, because the war has changed.
It used to be a <unk> between states.
Not not.
Now it's a conflict between states and non-governmental actors now.
For example, from the <unk> arrangements of peace -- between 1975, and 2011, <unk> came between a state and a government <unk>
So we have to understand these <unk> we even need to be <unk> or <unk> in any process of successful conflict.
But how do you do it?
We have to know what motivates these organizations.
We know very well the reasons why they are going to do it, but no one really analyzes what they do when they don't <unk>
The armed struggle and policies are not <unk>
It's all part of the same organization.
We can't understand these groups, not much less <unk> without a global view.
The armed groups are complex organizations.
For example, <unk> <unk> known for its violent <unk>
From its creation in the 1930s, <unk> has also established a political party, a network of social services and a military device.
Similarly, the Palestinian Palestinian known for their suicide attacks, against Israel, also runs the <unk> of Gaza from 2007.
So these groups do more than just to photograph.
They're multitasking
It would be a complex machinery of HIV stations radio stations websites and strategies in social networks.
And here you have the <unk> <unk> in English and published to <unk>
The armed groups are also investing in a complex cycle of funding without <unk> but by business <unk> for example, building companies.
These activities are key.
They allow these groups to increase their strength, increase their <unk> to recruit better and build their brand.
The armed groups also do something else -- create stronger ties with their population investing in social services.
They build schools, they run in hospitals, they put professional training programs or <unk>
<unk> offers all these services and more.
The armed groups are also trying to conquer the population by offering something that the state doesn't make security and protection.
The rise of the Taliban in a Afghanistan caused by war or even the beginning of the rise of <unk> can also be able to look at the efforts of these groups to make safety.
Unfortunately, in these cases, security has a price that's high for the population.
But in general, providing social services to fill a vacuum, a <unk> gap for the government, and it allows these groups to strengthen and increase their power.
For example, victory election from 2006 in the Palestinian Hamas cannot be able to recognize the social work of the group.
It's a really complex stage in the West, even in the West, when we look at groups -- we just think about the violent side.
But that's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups, the strategy or the long-term vision.
These groups are <unk>
<unk> because they fill <unk> gaps by the government, and emerge as armed groups, political groups, participate in the violent struggle and make governance.
And the more complex and sophisticated people are these organizations, less we can <unk> as something opposite to a state.
How do you call a group like <unk>
It was part of a soil, they run all of their <unk> and they run the trash system.
This is a home. It's a <unk> group.
Or perhaps something else, something new and different.
And what is <unk>
The lines are <unk>
We live in a world of states, from nations without state and two, and the more weak people are the states, as in the Middle East, the <unk> and they fill that gap the government <unk>
This is important for governments, because to counter these groups will have to invest more <unk>
It has to have that government vacuum has to be in the center of any sustainable approach.
This is very important to establish and put the peace.
If we understand better groups -- we will understand better what incentives offer to foster violence to violence to not violence.
In this new <unk> between states and actors don't <unk> the military power can win some paths but not to be peace and stability.
To achieve these goals we need to get long-term investments to fill that vacuum vacuum to fill that empty government that allowed these groups to thrive in a beginning.
Thank you.
I'm a failure as a woman and like a second.
My opinions about gender equality are <unk> but I'm afraid that accepting openly the <unk> tag would be unfair for the <unk>
I'm a <unk> but quite bad.
And so I'm going to tell you as a bad storyteller.
Or at least, I wrote a paper, and a book called "The <unk> and then in interviews, people started to call this <unk> <unk>
So what started as a personal joke that was meant to myself, and a <unk> <unk> has become a bigger thing.
Let me give you a step back.
When I was young, especially in my youth and at the 20 years, I had strange ideas about the <unk> these women <unk> <unk> with the men and <unk> the sex.
Today, I see how women are, women all over the world and anger, in particular, it looks like a perfectly reasonable answer.
But at the time, I was worried about the tone that was using people to the <unk> that I could be a <unk>
It will be labeled as a feminist was a <unk> a taboo and nasty word.
I was <unk> as a woman who doesn't follow the rules, who asked too high self-esteem and <unk> to believe it's equal or higher to a man.
Nobody wants to be that woman <unk> until it realizes that it's actually that woman and can't imagine being another person.
Over time, as I was growing up, I started to accept that I am, in fact, <unk> and also proud to be.
For me, certain claims are <unk> women are equal to men.
It would take the same job for the same job.
We have a right to travel around the world as it is <unk> free or violence.
We have a right to use it as easy and accessible to contraceptives and services.
We have the right to decide about our bodies, without the need to monitor <unk> or doctrines <unk>
We have the right to respect.
There are more.
When you talk about the needs of women, you have to have the other <unk>
We're not just women.
We are people with a different body, expression of gender, religion and <unk> condition, and so much more.
We have to have to realize these differences and how we care about the same way that we have in common.
Without this kind of <unk> our feminism is nothing.
For me, these truths are <unk> but to be clear. I'm a disaster.
I'm full of these.
There's a lot of things that make me a bad feminist stuff.
I have another confession.
When I go to work, I hear rap rap -- all volume.
Although the letter serves the women and it feels deep -- the classic <unk> <unk> of the Consumption, yang <unk> is amazing.
<unk> actually with your <unk> t-shirt with you.
<unk> <unk>
Think about it.
<unk> poetry, right?
I'm completely <unk> by my musical purpose.
I firmly believe in the work of man, which is everything I don't want to do, <unk>   all the tasks -- but also killing insects, the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
The pink is my favorite color.
<unk> of fashion magazines and very nice things.
I can see "The <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and I have erotic fantasies of the fairy tales that they get done.
Some of my crime are more <unk>
If a woman wants to adopt the name of his husband, it's his choice, and I'm not who <unk>
If a woman decides to stay at home to raise their children, I accepted that choice, too.
The problem is not that it becomes economically vulnerable through this same choice, the problem is that our society is <unk> in a way that women are economically vulnerable when they were <unk>
<unk> this problem.
<unk> the conventional feminism who has ignored or <unk> historically the needs of the women of color, the gay and gay workers, and <unk> for white women <unk> <unk> <unk>
One, if that's good feminism -- I'm a very bad feminist
It also happens the following: As a <unk> I feel a lot of pressure.
We have this tendency to put <unk> in a <unk>
We expect it to be able to get it down to the way.
When we get rid of the <unk> with a lot of taste from the same <unk> where the <unk>
As I said, I'm a <unk> I already consider that <unk> before you try to put up there.
<unk> women, particularly innovative and the leaders of the sector, are afraid of being tagged as <unk>
They are afraid to stand up and say, "Yes, I'm <unk> by fear that it means that he has not to be able to meet the <unk>
Take for example to <unk> or like I call it, <unk>
In the last few years, it's a <unk> feminist
In the <unk> Music <unk> in <unk> <unk> in front of the word <unk> of three feet tall.
It was a show of show, looking at this star of poop embrace openly feminism and to know women and young men who are feminist is something to be proud of.
<unk> the time, the cultural critics started debates with endless debates if they were <unk> it was or not just a few, or not just a few, or not the <unk>
They were able to figure out their PMS, rather than simply to believe the word of an adult and <unk> woman.
<unk> perfection of the <unk> because we're still struggling for a lot, we want a lot, we need a lot, we need so much.
We're going to go far beyond the sensible criticism and <unk> to <unk> feminism from any woman, <unk> until it is not anything.
We don't need to do that.
<unk> or more well, a more inclusive feminism is the point of <unk>
But what happens next?
We went to recognize our <unk> to give it to the action and be a little bit more <unk>
If I hear <unk> music, I'm creating a demand for artists that would be more happy to make a <unk> supply.
These artists will not change their way to talk about women in their songs until they <unk> change effectively their profits.
It's certainly hard.
Why has their music to be so <unk>
It's hard to choose something better and so easy to justify a worse choice.
But when the bad decisions are done, it makes it more difficult for women to achieve equality, equality that we all deserve and is our responsibility.
I think of my <unk> three and four years.
These are two girls and <unk> and bright and also very <unk> I want you to grow in a world.
It's where they were being told by the strong creatures that they are.
I think of them, all of a sudden, the best option would become a lot easier to do.
We can all make better decisions.
We can change the channel when a TV program is about sexual violence against women as sport, <unk> the Nobel <unk>
We can change the radio <unk> when we hear songs that treat women like nothing.
We can spend our money to go to cinema in another part when movies are not treating women more than <unk> objects.
We can stop supporting professional sports where athletes are treating their peers as <unk>
In any case, men, especially young men can say, "No, I'm not going to publish in his magazine, participate in his project, or work with you, until you don't include a number of women, so much to participate in how to make decisions.
I'm not going to work with you until your <unk> or your organization is more <unk> with a wider range of people.
Those of us who are <unk> but <unk> to participate in these kinds of projects, we can also be able to be even even as much as we can get to <unk> to overcome barriers to the decision jobs.
We are no longer <unk> Without these efforts, without taking these <unk> our achievements are going to mean very little.
We can make these small acts of courage and hope that our decisions will come to the top, to the people in power directors and film producers and music, <unk> the <unk> the people who can make great decisions, more courageous, to create a basic environmental and meaningful change.
We can also be able to say with the courage of our passion, well, bad, or any <unk>
The last line of my book, <unk> <unk> says, <unk> be a bad feminist not to be <unk>
This is true because of many reasons, but I say, most of all, because I <unk> my voice was <unk> and feminism helped me <unk>
There was a incident.
I call it the incident to deal with what happened.
A few kids were told when I was very young, and I didn't know that kids can do this to a girl.
They were treated as if it was nothing.
I started to believe that it was nothing.
It would be my voice, and after everything I didn't tell myself to believe that I could say something that could matter.
But I was writing.
And so I went back to <unk>
I was going to focus on a stronger version of myself.
The words of those women who could understand a story like mine, and the women who looked at me and understood what meant to live in this world if you have the brown skin.
The words of the women who showed me was nothing.
I learned to write like them, and then I learned to write like myself.
I found my voice again, and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what you can measure.
Through the writing of it, I also discovered that if I was a little brave one, another woman could hear and see me and realize that none of us is nothing that the world is about telling us that we are.
In one hand, I have the power to achieve anything.
And on the other, I do argue that I'm just a woman.
I'm a bad <unk> I'm a good woman, I'm trying to improve my way to think, what I say and what I do, without leaving everything that makes me human.
I hope we all can do the same thing.
I hope we all can be a little bit courageous, when you need such a <unk>
Right after Christmas last year, <unk> children in California had <unk> for having been exposed to somebody who had been there.
The virus then went through the border with Canada, <unk> over 100 children in <unk>
One of the <unk> things about this outbreak is that the <unk> that can be terrible for a child with an immune immune system, it's one of the most easily <unk> diseases.
There's a effective vaccine against this for more than half a century but many of the kids involved in the outbreak <unk> had not been poorer because their parents were afraid of something supposedly <unk> autism.
But a moment, it was not the article that unleashed the argument about autism and vaccines would be able to be able to, and marked by being a <unk> fraud by the British Medical Center.
It doesn't believe most smart scientists that vaccines cause autism is a <unk>
I think most of you know it, but millions of parents all around the world are still <unk> that vaccines will pay their children to have autism.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of the estimates of autism in time.
For most of the 20th century, autism was considered a very strange disease.
The few psychologists and pediatricians that I had heard of her are creating all his professional life without seeing one case.
For decades, the estimates of prevalence followed stable just three or four children per <unk>
But then, in the 1990s in 1990, the numbers started to <unk>
<unk> <unk> as <unk> <unk> refer to autism as an epidemic as if I could get it from another child in <unk>
What's going on?
If you're not vaccines, what is it?
If you ask people from the Center for Disease Control of Atlanta what's going on, they tend to be going on, they tend to based on phrases like <unk> diagnosis and "a better detection detection to explain these <unk> numbers.
But that kind of language doesn't <unk> a lot of the fears of a young mother who was looking for the face of his son of two years, the visual contact of it.
If the criteria criteria had to figure out why they were so <unk>
Why were the cases of autism so hard to find before the decade of <unk>
Five years ago, I decided to discover the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened is less than to do with slow progress and <unk> of science that with the <unk> of storytelling.
For most of the 20th century, doctors told a story about what autism is and how it was discovered, but that story turned out to be fake, and the consequences of the same is having a devastating impact in global public health.
There was a second more accurate story of autism that had lost and forgotten in the dark corners of the clinical literature.
This second story tells us all about how we get here and where we have to go.
The first story begins with a child psychiatrist Leo <unk> at Johns Hopkins Hospital. In <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> who looked at 11 young patients who looked at the people around them, even their own parents.
They could fun for hours by waving their hands in front of their faces, but they were prey from panic for <unk> as when they didn't put their favorite toy in their usual place without knowing them.
On the basis of patients treated in their clinic, <unk> <unk> that autism is very weird.
For the decade of 1950, as the main authority of the world in the subject, declared that I had seen less than 150 true cases of their syndrome as <unk> references of places as far as South Africa.
This is actually not wonder because the criteria for <unk> for autism diagnosis were very <unk>
For example, <unk> giving that diagnosis to children with <unk> but now we know that epilepsy, it's very common in autism.
Once it was <unk> that he had become nine of every 10 kids sent by the other doctors to his office, for being autistic without giving them a diagnosis of autism.
<unk> was a smart man, but part of his theories were not <unk>
<unk> autism as a form of <unk> <unk> and <unk>
These kids, he said, they were kept very carefully at a refrigerator that was not <unk>
At the same time, however, <unk> noticed that some of his young patients had special skills that cluster in certain areas like music, mathematics and memory.
One of the kids in their clinic could distinguish between 18 <unk> before I got two years.
When his mother put one of his favorite records, he said, <unk>
But <unk> had a bad opinion of these skills, and it tells things like the kids were simply <unk> what they had heard of their parents <unk> desperate to win their own.
As a result, autism became a source of embarrassment for families, and two generations of autistic children were sent to institutions for their own good, becoming invisible to the world in general.
Now, amazingly, it wasn't until the decade of 1970, the researchers started testing the <unk> theory that autism was weird.
<unk> <unk> a cognitive cognitive psychologist, I thought that the theory of mothers in <unk> was pretty stupid.
She and her husband was John and <unk> and <unk> and they had a deep autistic daughter called <unk>
<unk> and John knew how difficult it was to raise a little girl as black-eyed services, without special education, no access to other resources without a diagnosis.
To defend the National Health Service that needed more resources for autistic children and their families, <unk> and their colleague, Judith kick. decided to do something that should be done about 30 years before.
They did a study of autism prevalence in the general population.
It was a suburb of London called <unk> to try to find the autistic kids in the community.
What you saw was clear that the model of <unk> was too limited, because the reality of autism was much more <unk> and diverse and diverse and diverse <unk>
Some children could not talk at all, whereas others were <unk> in their fascination with the astrophysics, in dinosaurs or the <unk> of <unk>
In the other way, these children didn't fit in nice <unk> and <unk> as he said <unk> and they saw a lot of them, much more than the <unk> model of <unk> would have predicted.
At first, they were lost by trying to make sense of their data.
How did nobody have been aware of these kids before?
But then <unk> I found a reference to an article published in German in <unk> the next year to the <unk> article -- and then he was <unk> buried under the ashes of a terrible time that nobody wanted to remember.
He knew about this article from the competition, but I avoided <unk> <unk> in his own work.
There was no even one translation of the English but luckily, the husband of <unk> I was talking German -- and he <unk> him for her.
The document offers an alternative story of autism.
His author was a man named Hans <unk> who ran a clinical clinic with a school school in conjunction in the 1930s.
The ideas of Asperger's for the teaching of children with their learning differences were <unk> even for contemporary standards.
The morning in his clinic began with music classes with music, and the kids kept their games on top of the afternoon.
Instead of blaming the parents of causing autism, Asperger's described as a <unk> disability of life that required <unk> forms of support and spaces for the course of all life.
Instead of treating kids in their clinic as patients, Asperger's called her little teachers, and he went to help in the development of education methods that were especially right for them.
And I tried to see autism as a diverse continuum that took an amazing variety of dollars and disability.
He believed that autism and the autistic traits were common and they have always been, seeing aspects of this continuum in <unk> known in <unk> culture as the awkward social scientist, and Professor <unk>
He went beyond even to say, for success in science and art, a bit of autism is essential.
<unk> and Judith found out that <unk> was wrong that autism was <unk> as well as the parents were <unk>
Over the next few years, worked with the American American Association to expand the criteria of the diagnosis that reflect the diversity of what they called <unk> <unk>
By the late '80s and early '90s, their changes went into <unk> and we have a limited model of <unk> by a broad <unk>
These changes were not in <unk>
<unk> when I <unk> and Judith worked in the <unk> to reform these <unk> people from all over the world see an autistic adult for the first time.
Before it came out <unk> <unk> in 1988, only a small circle, <unk> by experts who knew what autism, but after the <unk> performance of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> with four Nobel <unk> <unk> teachers and parents all over the world knew what the autism.
At the same time, the first very easy clinical evidence is to use to diagnose autism.
I shouldn't have a connection with that little circle of experts to get a diagnosis for his son.
The combination of <unk> <unk> the changes in the criteria and the introduction of these tests created a network, a perfect storm of the consciousness of autism.
The number of diagnostics started to <unk> the same as they predicted <unk> and <unk> in fact they were hoping that this outside -- so that people with autism and their families will finally support support and services that are <unk>
So Andrew <unk> got to blame vaccines for the increase in <unk> a simple simple, powerful, <unk> history as bad as the <unk> theory that autism was <unk>
If the current estimate of the center of prevention that one of every 68 children in America are in the spectrum, it's right -- the autistic are one of the largest <unk> groups.
Over the last few years, people are autistic people have joined the Internet to reject the idea that they are the puzzles by solving for the new medical advances -- <unk> the term <unk> to celebrate the varieties of human cognition.
One way to understand <unk> is to think about terms of living operating systems.
The fact that a PC doesn't work, doesn't mean it's <unk>
According to the <unk> <unk> the normal human brain is easily easily <unk> <unk> and it suffers from a attention deficit to the details.
Indeed, autistic people have difficulty living in a world not built for them.
70 years later, we're still reaching <unk> who believed that <unk> for the most compelling aspects of autism are in the understanding of teachers, employers with ability, communities of support, and the parents with faith in the potential of their children.
A autistic woman called <unk> <unk> once once said, "We need all the hands on cover to <unk> the <unk>
As we go to an uncertain future, we need all the forms of human intelligence on the planet to address the challenges that we face as a society.
We can't afford to bring up and a brain.
Thank you.
